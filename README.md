## The Dictionary as Data
This repository contains all of code (as R scripts) and data used to produce the quantitative analysis and visualizations for my contribution to the *Cambridge Handbook of the Dictionary*.

All of the code is authored in R and the scripts are located in the **R** folder. To run the code, download or clone the repository and open R project file (**dictionary\_as_data.Rproj**) which is located in the main directory.
