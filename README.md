## The Dictionary as Data
This repository contains all of code and data used to produce the quantitative analysis and visualizations for my contribution to the *Cambridge Handbook of the Dictionary*.

## The Code
All of the code is authored in R and the scripts are located in the **R** folder. To run the code, download or clone the repository and open R project file (**dictionary\_as_data.Rproj**) which is located in the main directory.

If you are familiar with R and R Studio, everything here should be relatively intuitive, though some of the processing is computationally intensive.

If you are not familiar with R, you will need to install R and R Studio and [familiarize yourself with at least some basics](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-getting-started-with-r-and-rstudio/).
