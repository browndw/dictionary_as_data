There is a Tradition of a Dilemma, that Bishop Morton (Chancellor to H. 7.) used, to raise up the Benevolence to higher rates, and some called it his Fork and some his Crotea cent ; for he had concluded an Article in the Instructions to the Commissioners, who were to leavy the Benevolence; That if they met with any that were sparing, they should tell them, they must needs have, because they laid up; And if they were spenders, they must needs have, because it was seen in their port and manner of living. I. Bac. Hen. 7. p. 101.
