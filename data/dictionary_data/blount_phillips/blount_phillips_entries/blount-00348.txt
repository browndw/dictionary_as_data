Allusion (allusio) a likening or applying of one thing to another, and it is as it were a dalliance or playing with words like in sound, unlike in sense, by changing, adding, or substracting a letter or two; so that words nicking and resembling one the other, are appliable to different significations. As the Almighty (if we may herein use a sacred Authority) in ratification of his promise to the seed of Isaac, changed Abram, high Father, into Abraham, that is, Father of many; and Sarai that is, my Dame, into Sara, that is, Lady or Dame. The Greeks nicked Antiochus Epiphanes, that is, the famous, with Epimanes, that is, the furious. The Romans likewise plaid with bibbing Tiberius Nero, calling him Biberius Mero. So in Quintilian, the sour fellow Placidus was called Acidus, and of late one called Scaliger, Aliger. Cam. Rem. fol. 158.
