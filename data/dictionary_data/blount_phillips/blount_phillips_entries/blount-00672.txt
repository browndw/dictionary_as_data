Apoplexy (apoplexia) a very dangerous disease, wherein a man lies without sense or motion, as if he were dead, with his eyes closed, and great difficulty in fetching his breath; it comes for the most part of cold and gross flegmatick humors, oppressing the brain in such sort that the Animal spirits cannot pass from thence into the sinews, as they were wont. It either causeth present death, or else ends in a dead Palsey.
