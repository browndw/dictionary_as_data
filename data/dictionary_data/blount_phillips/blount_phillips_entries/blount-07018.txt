Nostoch (says Dr. Charlton in his Paradoxes) is the nocturnal pollution of some plethorical and wanton star, or rather excrement blown from the nostrils of some rheumatick Planet, falling upon plains and sheep pastures, of an obscure red or brown tawny, in consistence like a gelly, and so trembling if touched; which the Philosophy of the clouted shoo affirms to be the ruines of a star fallen. Some there are (saith Dornaeus) who by Nostoch intend wax, but by the favor of a metaphor.
