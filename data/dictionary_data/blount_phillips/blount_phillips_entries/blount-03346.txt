Eclipse of the Moon never happens but at her full, nor then always, but when she is in such a point that the interposition of the earth deprives her of the Sun beams, from whence she taketh her light. Eclipse of the Sun is not so usual, and happens onely at the change of the Moon, as when the Moon, being between the Sun and us, doth, with her dark body, hide part of his light from us: Which was the cause that Dionysius Areopagita (seeing the Sun so admirably eclipsed at our Saviours Passion, contrary to all reason, when the Moon was not in any nearness to hinder his light) cryed out in amazement. Aut Deus naturae patitur, aut machina mundi dissolvetur. Either the God of Nature suffers, or else the frame of the world will be destroyed. Bull.
