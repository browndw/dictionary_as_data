Cronie (from cronus) a contemporary Disciple, or intimate companion, between a servant and friend; a consident; and perhaps may have this antient Etymology; Diodorus the Philosopher was Schollar to Apollonius Cronus, after whom he was called Cronus, the name of the Master being transmitted to the Disciple.
