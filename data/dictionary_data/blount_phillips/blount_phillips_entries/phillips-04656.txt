Faces, Decury, or Deconate, from the Greek word Deka, signifying ten, because in every Sign there are three Faces, every Face consisting of ten degrees. They are called Faces for that they are equivalent to Signs, Formes, and shapes, by reason they shew the nature and inclination of the Planets in them as in their own houses.
