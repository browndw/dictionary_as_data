Bek or Bec, a Phrygian word, signifying bread. Herodotus declares lib. 2. that Psammeticus a King of the Egyptians, was desirous on a time to make trial what language a Childe would naturally speak, being brought up among dumb people, or where no speech should be heard, to the end he might judge thereby, what was the most antient and natural Language; and did therefore cause two children to be nursed in a Forest, where no voice of man could be heard; after four years were past, being brought before the King they could sometimes pronounce this word Bec, whereupon some gathered that the Phrygian was the first language of man. But (as St. Augustine saith) these children might have learned the word Bec (and so retained it) of Goats, among which they were nourished. For, as he shews in his Work of the quantity of the Soul, all manner of speaking is by hearing and imitation. Notwithstanding he believes that (before the confusion of Tongues at Babel) the Hebrew Language was natural to all. Aug. in Civit. Dei lib. 16. cap. 11.
