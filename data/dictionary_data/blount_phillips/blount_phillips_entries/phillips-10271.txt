SAbaoth, (from the Hebrew Scabath to rest,) a celebration of the seventh day of the week; as a day of rest among the Jews, in remembrance of Gods resting from the work of the creation on that day, instead of which the first day of the week, called the Lords day, hath been ever observed by Christians, in remembrance of Christs Resurrection.
