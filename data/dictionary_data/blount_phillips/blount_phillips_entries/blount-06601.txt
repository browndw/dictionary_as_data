Minnyng days (from the Sax. Gemynde, i. the mind, q. Mynding days) Bede hist. lib. 4. ca 30. Commemorationis dies; days which our Ancestors called their Moneths minde, their Years mind, and the like, being the days whereon their Souls (after their deaths) were had in special remembrance, and some Office or Obsequies said for them; as Obits, Dirges, &c. This word is still retained in Lancashire; but elsewhere more commonly called Anniversary days.
