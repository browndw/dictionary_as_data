Gordius, a King of Phrygia, who being raised from the plough to the Throne, hung up the furniture of his oxen in the Temple, as a memorial, which being tied in a very intricate knot, and the Monarchy of the World being promised to him that could untie it, Alexander the Great after he had long tried in vain, at length cut it in two with his sword, whence the Gordian knot came to be a proverb, being taken for any thing which is difficult to be expounded.
