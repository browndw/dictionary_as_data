Cataphrygians. A Sect of Hereticks that lived in the time of Pope Soter, and the Emperor Commodus about the year of Christ 181. they bore that name, because their Arch-leaders, Montanus and Apelles were of the Country Phrygia; they erred about Baptism, rejecting the form that Christ and his Apostles used; they baptized their dead, held two Marriages as bad as fornication, with other wicked Tenets.
