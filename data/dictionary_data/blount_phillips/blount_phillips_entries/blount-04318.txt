Frank-Almoin (libera Eleemosyna) in French Franc Aumosne, signifies in our Common Law a Tenure or Title of Lands. Britton (Cap. 66. num. 5.) saith thus of it. Frank-Almoine is Lands or Tenements bestowed upon God, that is, given to such people as bestow themselves in the service of God, for pure and perpetual Almes, whence the Feoffers or givers cannot demand any terrestrial service, so long as the Lands remain in the hands of the Feoffees.
