The Corinthian Stater was worth 21 d. want a farthing. The Macedonian Stater was worth about two shillings nine pence half penny. The Golden Attick Stater weighed two drams, and therefore worth seventeen shillings six pence. But in Scripture it valued two Didrams; for the tribute money to be paid for each person was Didrachmum. Mat. 17.24. and a Stater was paid for two, namely, for Christ and St. Peter, the value of it therefore was 2s. 6d.
