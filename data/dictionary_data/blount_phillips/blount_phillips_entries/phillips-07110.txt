Lent-season, (in Lat. Quadragesima) a Fast of fourty dayes, instituted by the Church, and first appointed to be kept in England by Ercombert a King of Kent. It comes from the Dutch word Lente, i. Spring, because it ever happens to be about the beginning of the Spring time, or as others say, from length, because about this time the dayes begin to lengthen.
