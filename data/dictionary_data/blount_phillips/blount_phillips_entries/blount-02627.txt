Curfeu, comes of the Fr. Couvrir, i. to cover, and feu, the fire; we use it for the eight o'th clock Bell, or an evening Peal, by which the Conqueror in the first year of his reign, willed every man to take warning for the raking up his fire, and putting out his light. So that in many places at this day, where a Bell is customably rung towards Bed-time, it is said to ring Curfeu. Stows Ann. and Sir Rich. Baker, fol. 34.
