Opposite (oppositum) a contrary. Aristotle makes four kinds of Opposites; first, those that are relativA opposita, as the Husband and Wife, the Master and Servant, &c. which have reference each to other. Secondly, those which are Contraria; as Right and Wrong; Ignorance, and Science, &c. Thirdly, Those that are privativA opposita, as Light and Darkness, Sight and Blindness, which succeed and deprive one another. The fourth and last kind of Opposites are those which in Propositions and Clauses are Contradicentia, the one affirming, and the other negative, &c. J. Doderidge.
