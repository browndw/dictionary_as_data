Nor are these inventions altogether laid aside at present: For one Mr. Yates, hath three Yates or Gates in his Seal, and the Motto, Sit quarta Coeli. And I have seen some Signs in London, that near amount to Rebusses, as one whose name is Choppington, has for his Sign an Ax, Chopping a Tun. But Rebusses may be of other matters as well as names; and therefore may be defined to be Representations of ordinary or odd things, accompanied with equivocal Motto's or words, which as they stand, seem to make a Sentence, but pronounced without stop, describe the things represented. For example, a Fool being painted kneeling, with a Horn at his mouth, and the words Fol age nous trompe, near him; pronounce them another way, and you have Fol A genous trompe. See Peacham, l. 3. p. 155.
