Vicount alias Viscount, (vicecomes) signifies with us as much as Sheriff; Between which two words I finde no other difference, but that the one comes from our Conquerors, the Normans; and the other from our Ancestors, the Saxons. Viscount also signifies a degree of Nobility next an Earl, which (as Camden saith) is an old name of Office, but a new one of Dignity, never heard of among us till Henry the Sixth's dayes. But this degree of honor is far more ancient in other Countries. See Cassan. de gloria Mundi. part. 5. Consid. 55.
