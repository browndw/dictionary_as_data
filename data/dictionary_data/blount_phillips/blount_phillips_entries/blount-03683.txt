Equivocal (aequivocus) that hath a double or doubtful signification. An Equivocal word is that which contains more significations then one, or that which serves for several notions. As the word Arms, in our vulgar use, equally signifies those parts of our body so called, or weapons or tokens of honor, and with an aspiration (which is an Elench or deceit in the Accent) harmes. See Per. Instit. p. 18.
