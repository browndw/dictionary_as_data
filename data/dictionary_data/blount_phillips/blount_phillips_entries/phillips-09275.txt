Pledge, (French) a surety, whence to pledge one in drinking, is to be his surety, or to ingage that he shall receive no harm while he is drinking, which custom was first occasioned, as some say, by reason of the practice of the Danes, heretofore in this Kingdom, who used frequently to stab the Natives while they were drinking.
