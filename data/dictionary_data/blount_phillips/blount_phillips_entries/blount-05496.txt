Spanish Inquisition, was first created, and called the Sacred Council of Inquisition, about or not long after the year, 1492. at which time the Empire of the Moors ended in Spain by the valor of Fardinand the Catholick. Such Moors, as after the decay of their Kingdom, staid in Spain, were by a Statute in that case provided, to be christned. And that they might be known to be, as they professed, this Inquisition was ordained, consisting of a President (and he always an Ecclesiastical person, as the Archbishop of Tolledo, or Sevil) assisted by twelve other Councellors, who deal altogether in matters appertaining to Religion.
