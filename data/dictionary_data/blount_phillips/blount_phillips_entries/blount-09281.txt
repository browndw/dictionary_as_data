Satyre (satyrus) a Wood-wose; a strange monster, having the body of a man all hairy, with legs and feet like a Goat, full of motion, and given much to venery and jeering, which the Poets were wont to call gods of the Woods; these (as Pliny testifies, lib. 7. cap. 2.) were found in times past in the Eastern Mountains of India. And St. Hierome in the life of St. Anthony reports, he saw one of these in his time: Vidi homunculum (inquit) aduncis naribus, & fronte cornibus aspera, cui extrema corporis in caprarum pelles desinebant, &c. But the truth hereof, I will not rashly impugn, nor over boldly affirm. And Satyres shall dance there, Isa. 13 21.
