Carthusians, a religious order of Monks, instituted by St. Bruno, a native of Collein, who being a Parisian Doctor of Divinity, and a Canon of Rheims, abandoned the world, and with six associats began his austere Heremitical course of life, on the Carthusian Mountains, in the Diocess of Gratianopolis, with the licence of Hugh then Bishop thereof; and from thence his Order took the name of Carthusians: he flourished in the time of Pope AErban the second, and died 1101. Those of his rule have at this day near 100 Monasteries; they eat no flesh, never meet but on Sundays, labour with their hands, watch, pray, &c. their robe is white, with a short cape.
