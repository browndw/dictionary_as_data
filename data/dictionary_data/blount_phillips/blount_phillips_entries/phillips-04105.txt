St. Edmundsbury, a Town in Suffolk, anciently called Bederick's gueord, i. e. the Court, or Mansion-house of Bederick, and seems to have been the same Town with that, which Antonine calleth Villa Faustini. It derived its present name from King Edmund, who was cruelly put to death by the Danes, and his body translated hither, a stately Church being also erected to his memory, which being demolished by Suenus the Dane, was built anew by his son Canutus to expiate his fathers sacriledge.
