Mosaique or Musaical work (Mosaicum, musaeacum vel Musivum opus) is a most curious work wrought with stones of divers colours, and divers mettles, into the shape of knots, flowers, and other devices, with that excellency of cunning, that they seem all to be one stone, and rather the work of Nature then Art. Sir Henry. Wotton describes it thus, Mosaique is a kind of painting in smal Pebbles, Cockles, and shels of sundry colours; and of late dayes, likewise with peeces of glass, figured at pleasure; An ornament, in truth, of much beauty, and long life, but of most use in Pavements and floarings. El. of Archit. p. 261.
