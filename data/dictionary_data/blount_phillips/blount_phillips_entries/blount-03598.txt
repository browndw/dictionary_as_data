Epact (epacta) the day put to or added to make the Leap year; or it is a number of eleven days, in which the common Solar year exceeds the common Lunar year, the one consisting of 365 days, the other of 354 days, and therefore they add the excess unto the Lunar year to coequal them; For Epacta comes from a in non-Latin alphabet a, which signifies intercalare or addere; by the addition of which excess in every four years, there is gotten a number more then 30, which is greater then the Epact can be, because from Change to Change there can be but Thirty days; therefore Thirty must be taken from that excess, and the remainder is the Epact for the next year; As 1659. the Epact is Seventeen, whereto add Eleven, which makes Twenty eight, that is the Epact for the next year.
