Demain or Demeasn (from the Lat. Dominicum, or Fr. Demain or Domain) signifies as much as Patrimonium Domini. Hotaman in verbis feudalibus, verbo Dominicum, by divers Authorities, proves those lands to be Dominicum, which a man holds originally of himself; and those to be feodum, which he holds by the benefit of a superior Lord. But this word is now most commonly used for a distinction between those Lands that the Lord of a Mannor hath in his own hands, or in the hands of his Lessee; and such other Lands appertaining to the said Mannor, which belong to Free or Copy-holders; howbeit the Copy-hold belonging to any Mannor, is also in the opinion of many good Lawyers, accounted Demeasn.
