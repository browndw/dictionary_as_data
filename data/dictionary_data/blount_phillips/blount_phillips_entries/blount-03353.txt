Eddy, Is the running back of the water in some place, contrary to the Tide or stream, and so falling into the tyde again, which happens by reason of some head-land or point in a River, jutting out suddenly, and so hindering the full current which the water had before it came to that Point. And an Eddy wind, is that wind, which recoils from any Sail, or Halse going contrary to that wind whence it proceeds, but is never so strong as the other.
