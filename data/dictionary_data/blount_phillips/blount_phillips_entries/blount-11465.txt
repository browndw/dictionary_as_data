Wea-bit or Way-bit, is a word used in the North of England, where if you ask how far 'tis to such a place, they answer, a mile and a VVay-bit, by which is understood a mile and vantage, or a mile and better. I finde ia cent written Wea-bit, but conceive it should be Way-bit; quasi, a bit or part of a way.
