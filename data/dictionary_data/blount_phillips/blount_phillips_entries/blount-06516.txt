Meridian (circulus meridianus) is an immovable, and one of the greater circles passing through the Poles of the world; it is called the Meridian of Merides, noon-tide, because when the Sun, rising from the East, toucheth this Line with the center of his body, then it is noon to those over whose Zenith that circle passeth, and midnight to their Antipodes. The number of Meridians, are 180 (allowing two to every degree in the Equinoctial) which all intersect in either Pole, and are the utmost bounds of longitude. Peacham.
