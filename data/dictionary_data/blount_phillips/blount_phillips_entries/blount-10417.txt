Tenebres (Fr. A tenebrae) darkness, obscurity; also the Service or Mattins used in the Roman Church on Wednesday Thursday and Friday before Easter, are call'd tenebrae, (and thence tenebrae-Wednesday, Thursday, &c.) as being begun with many lights, and ending in darkness, representing the night-time of our blessed Saviours apprehension in the Garden Gethsemani; in which Office are lighted at the first on a triangular candlestick fifteen candles, viz. as many as there are Psalms and Canticles in the Office, and at the end of every Psalm one of the fifteen lights is extinguished till they are all put out; so to shew the forsaken desolate state of our blessed Saviour in his passion, all the light or comfort of his friends leaving him, or being forced from him for a time, and he left alone suh potestate tenebrarum, under the power of darkness.
