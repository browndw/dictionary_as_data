Achilles, the son of Peleus and Thesis, whom his mother while he was an infant, dipt all over in the river Styx, so that he became invulnerable all over, save in that part of his heel, by which she held him, he was put to the Centaur Chiron, to be instructed in warlike affairs and musick; and being grown to age, his Mother hearing he should die in the Trojan wars put him into Womans apparel and hid him among the Daughters of Lycomede where he ravish't Deidamia, and begot Pyrrhus, being seduced from thence by the craft of Vlisses, he fought against the Trojans, slew Hector, and performed many other great exploits in that war.
