Predestination (praedestinatio) fore-appointment, an ordaining before what shall come after. It is most used in Divinity, and is thus defined by Sir Walt. Ral. in his first Book fol. 16. We can (saith he) difference Predestination no otherwise from Providence and Prescience, then in this, That Prescience onely foresees, Providence foresees and cares for, and hath respect to all creatures, even from the brightest Angels of Heaven to the unworthiest worms of the earth; And Predestination is onely of men, and yet not of all to men belonging, but of their salvation properly (in the common use of Divines)
