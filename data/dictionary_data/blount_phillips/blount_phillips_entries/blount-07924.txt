Phlebotomie (phlebotomia) the cutting a vein to let blood. Physicians (as 'tis written) learned this practise first of a beast called Hyppopotamus, living in the River Nylus, and being of a ravenous nature, therefore often over-charged with much eating, is wont to seek in the banks for some sharp stub of a Reed, upon which pricking his leg, he thereby easeth his full body; stopping the bleeding afterwards with mud.
