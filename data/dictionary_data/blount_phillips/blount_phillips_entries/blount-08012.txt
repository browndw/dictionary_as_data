Poesia cent (poesis) a Poets work, Poetry; there are six sorts of Poesie; the Heroick Poem Narrative is called an Epique Poem; the Heroick Poem Dramatique, is Tragedy; the Scommatick Narrative, is Satyre; Drammatick, is Comedy; the Pastoral Narrative, is called simply Pastoral (anciently Bucolique) the same Dramatique, Pastoral Comedy. The figure therefore of an Epique Poem, and of a Tragedy ought to be the same; for that they differ no more, but that they are pronounced by one or many persons. Mr. Hobbs.
