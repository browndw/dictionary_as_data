Sicilian Vesperas, is taken proverbially for mischiefs done, or death inslicted in a place and time of imagined security; from a general massacre of the French made on a sudden throughout Sicily (whereof they were over insolent masters) by the incensed Islanders (Anno 1582) and about five of the clock in the afternoon at the toll of a bell.
