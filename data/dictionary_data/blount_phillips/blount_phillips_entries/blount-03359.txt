Edil or Aedil (aedilis) an inferior Officer among the antient Romans, whose charge was to register Sanctions, oversee the Building of Temples, as also of private houses, such as our Church-wardens, or Surveyors, &c. And of these Aediles there were two sorts, Plebeii and Curules, as you may read in Godwins Anthol. ch. de Aedilibus.
