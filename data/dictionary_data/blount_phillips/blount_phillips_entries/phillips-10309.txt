Salique Law, a Law whereby the Crown of France cannot fall from the Lance to the distaffe, i. cannot be inherited by women; it is so called, either from these words si aliqua, often mentioned in the Law (which as some say was made by Pharamond, others by Philip the fair) or else from the River Sala, near unto which the Francks anciently inhabited.
