Church-Wardens (Ecclearum Gardiani seu custodes) are Officers yearly chosen by the consent of the Minister and Parishoners according to the custom of every several place, to look to the Church, Church-yard, and such things as belong to both, and to observe the behaviour of their Parishioners for such faults as appertain to the Jurisdiction or censure of the Court Ecclesiastical. They are a kind of Corporation enabled by Law to sue for any thing belonging to their Church, or poor of their Parish. See Lambert in his Pamphlet of the duty of Church-wardens.
