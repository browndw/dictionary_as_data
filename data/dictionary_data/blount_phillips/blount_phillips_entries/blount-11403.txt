Vrn (urna) a measure of liquid things, containing of old two Gallons and a Pottle; also the general name for a Pitcher or Pot; but most commonly taken for a Vessel or Coffin, wherein the ashes of the dead were kept; for the old Romans were wont to burn their dead bodies: Now it is often taken for a Grave or Sepulchre; also a vessel wherein the Roman Pretor did put the names of such as were to be elected or tried by lot. See a learned discourse of AErns, written lately by Dr. Brown, and entituled Hydriotaphia.
