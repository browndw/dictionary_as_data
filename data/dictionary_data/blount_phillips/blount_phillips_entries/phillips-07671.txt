Mausolus, a King of Caria, the husband of Artemisia, by whom he was so intirely loved, that after he was dead, she is said to have drunk up his ashes in wine, and built him a very stately Sepulcher, which from his name she called Mousoleum, being one of the seven wonders of the world, and from which every rich Monument is figuratively called a Mausoleum.
