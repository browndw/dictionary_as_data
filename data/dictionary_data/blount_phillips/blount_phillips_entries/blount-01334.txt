Bonhemes (Fr. i. good men) a religious Order of Friers instituted by St. Francis de Paula, a Town of Calabria in Italy: a person of eminent sanctity and austerity of life, and of that humility, that he stiled himself the least or meanest of men, and ordered the followers of his Institute or Rule, to take the appellation of Minimi (the least or unworthiest among men) and thence they are commonly called Minims or Minorites. One point of mortification, whereunto the Regulars of that Order tie themselves by vow (besides their three Vows of Chastity, Poverty, and Obedience) is a total abstinence from flesh-meats. It is an Order much reverenced in France, where the Founder lived, and died at Tours, an. 1507. There were two Convents of these formerly in England, the one at Asbridge in Buckinghamshire, the other at Edington in Wiltshire.
