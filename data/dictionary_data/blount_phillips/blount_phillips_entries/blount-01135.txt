Balme, a precious juyce or liquor, otherwise called Balsamum, or Opobalsamum (from the Hebr. Bagnal Shemen) It drops (by cutting) out of a little low plant (about a yard high) having leaves like Rue, but whiter, which grows in Egypt, and some places of the Holy Land. This juyce is somewhat like oyl, but more clammy, and inclining to a certain redness. It has a strong smell, and is not pleasant in taste. Being put in a vessel of water it will sink down to the bottom like a round pearl without breaking, and may be taken up again with the point of a knife. It is an excellent Medicine to take any scar out of the body, and for divers other purposes, but very costly and rarely gotten. Saladinus writes that there was but one Vineyard of these in the whole world, and that belonged to the Great Turk. Bull.
