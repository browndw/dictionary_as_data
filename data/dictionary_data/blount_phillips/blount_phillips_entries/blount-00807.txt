Arke (arca) in holy Scripture signifies two things. 1. The Ark made by Noah at the commandment of God, which was 300 Cubits long, (one foot and half to the Cubit) 50 Cubits broad, and 30 high, Gen. 6. which sheweth (according to Butaeo) the whole concavity to have been 450000. The remnants of which, Josephus saith, were in his time to be seen.
