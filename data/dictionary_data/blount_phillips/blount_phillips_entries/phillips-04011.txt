Dublin, the chief City of Ireland, situate in the Province of Leimster, it was antiently called Bala cleigh, i. a Town upon Hurdles.

This City was bravely defended by the English against Asculph Prince of the Dublinians, and Gottred King of the Isles, and in the time of King Henry the second, was given to a Colony of Bristowmen.
