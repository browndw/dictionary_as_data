The Feast of Expiation (among the antient Hebrews) was commanded to be celebrated on the tenth day of the moneth Tisri, answering to our September, Lev. 13. It was so called, because the High Priest did then confess unto God both his own sins and the sins of the people, and by the performance of certain Rites, and Ceremonies, expiate them, and make an atonement with God for them.
