Cistercians, a religious order of Monks instituted about the year of Christ 1088. under Pope AErban the second, by Robert, Abbot of the famous Monastery of Cisteaux in Burgundy, whence the observers of that institute were called Cistercians. Into that Monastery, entered afterward one Bernard, a Burgundian, who proved so strict an observer of Monastical discipline, and so eminent in sanctity and learning, that the Regulars of the aforesaid institute took their appellation from him, and were called Bernardines, and so are at this day sometimes called by the one name, sometimes by the other. Their uppermost robe is white and large, they eat no flesh, they follow in part St. Benets Rule. Of these we had several Monasteries in England, as Rivax, Garradon, Woburn, &c.
