Timariots, wheresoever any land is conquered by the Great Turk, it is divided into divers parts, and given to those they call Timariots, for term of life, with obligation to serve on horse-back wheresoever they shall be summoned; This is not much unlike our old Tenures of Knights service or Escuage, but not hereditary; According to the value of the timar or feud, the Timariot is to come in with one, two, three or more horses, &c. See Sir Hen. Blounts Voyage, fol. 65.
