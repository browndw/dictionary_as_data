Moneths (Sax. monaths) however taken are not exactly divisible into Septuaries or weeks, which fully contain seven dayes, whereof four times make compleatly twenty eight; For besides the usual or Calendary Moneth, there are but four considerable, that is the Moneth of Peragration or Apparition, of Consecution, and the Medical or Decretoa cent ial moneth; whereof some come short, others exceed this account. A Moneth of Peragration, is the time of the Moons revolution from any part of the Zodiack, unto the same again, and this contains but twenty seven days, and about eight hours. The Moneth of Consecution or (as some term it) of Progression, is the space between one conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, unto another; and this contains twenty nine days and a half. A Moneth of Apparition is the space wherein the Moon appears (deducting three days, wherein it commonly disappears; and being in combustion with the Sun, is presumed of less activity) and this contains but twenty six days, and twelve hours. The Medical Moneth, not much exceeds this, consisting of twenty six days, and twenty two hours, &c. See more in Dr. Br. Vul. Err. fo. 212.
