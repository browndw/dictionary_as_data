Shrove-tide, from the Sax. Shrive or Shrift, and the Belg. Tyde, i. tempus, a time of shriving or confessing sins; for about that time the Roman Catholicks use to confess their sins and receive the Blessed Sacrament, to the end they may the more religiously observe the holy time of Lent, then immediately ensuing.
