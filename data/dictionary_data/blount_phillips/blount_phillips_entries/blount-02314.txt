Conjuration (conjuratio) as it is compounded of (con and juro) signifies a compact or plot made by persons combining themselves together by Oath or Promise to do some publick harm. But in our Common Law it is used especially for such as have personal conference with the Devil or evil spirit, to know any secret, or to effect any purpose. An 5. Eliz. cap 16 And the difference between Conjuration and Witchcraft is, that the Conjurer seems by prayers and invocation of Gods powerful names, to compel the Devil to say or do what he commands him: The Witch deals rather by a friendly and voluntary conference or agreement between him or her, and the Devil or Familiar, to have his or her turn served for soul, blood, or other gift offered him: So that ala cent Conjurer compacts for curiosity to know secrets, and work marvels; and the Witch of meer malice to do mischief. And both these differ from Inchanters, or Sorcerers, because the former two have personal conference with the Devil, and the other meddle but with medicines, and ceremonial forms of words called Charmes, without apparition. Daltons J.P. 279
