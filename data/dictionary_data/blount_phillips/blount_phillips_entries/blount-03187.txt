Divorce (divortium, A diversitate mentium) the dissolution of marriage, a separation of man and wife, which was (as our Saviour witnesseth, Matth. 19.8.) first permitted by Moses to the Israelites, Deut. 24.1. for the hardness of their hearts, that men might rather put their Wives away, whom they grew weary of, then use them with too great extremity to shorten their lives, as many did; The woman so divorced was to have of her Husband a writing (as St Hierom and Josephus witness in l. de ant. 4. c. 8.) to this effect, I promise that hereafter I will lay no claim to thee, and this writing was called a Bill of Divorce. But with Christians this custom is abrogated, saving onely in case of Adultery. The antient Romans also had a custom of Divorce, among whom it was as lawful for the Wife to put away her Husband, as for the Husband to dismiss his Wife; But among the Israelties this prerogative was onely permitted to the Husband. See Repudiate.
