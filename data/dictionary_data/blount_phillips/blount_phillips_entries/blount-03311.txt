Dures (duritia) is in our Common Law a Plea used in way of exception, by him that being cast into Prison at a mans suit, or otherwise by beating or threats, hardly used, seals any Bond to him during his restraint. For the Law holds this not good, but rather supposeth it to be constrained. Brook in his Abridgment joyns Dures and Manasse together, i. Duritiam and Minas, hardness and threatning. See the new book of Entries, verbo Da cent res, and the new Terms of Law.
