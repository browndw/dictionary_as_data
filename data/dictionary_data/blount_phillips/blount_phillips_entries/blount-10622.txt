Tolsey or Toldsey, is a place in the City of Bristol, answerable to the Old Exchange in London, where the Merchants meet; and may perhaps be so called, because oft-times there is money told upon the heads of round posts or pillars made for that purpose; or from, Tol, i. vectigal and sey, i. sedes, the seat or place of paying Custom.
