Charybdig, A Gulph, or Whirl-pit on Sicily side of the narrow Seas between Sicily and Italy, which violently attracting all vessels that come too nigh it, devours them, and casts up their wrecks at the shoar of Tauronia, not far from Catana. Opposite to this in Italy stands the dangerous Rock Scylla, at whose foot many little Rocks shoot out, on which the waters strongly beating, make that noise which the Poets feign to be the barking of Dogs. This passage between these two being, to unskilful Marriners, exceeding perillous, gave rise to the proverb, Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare Charybdim.Who seeks Charybdis for to shun,Doth often times on Scylla run.Heyl.
