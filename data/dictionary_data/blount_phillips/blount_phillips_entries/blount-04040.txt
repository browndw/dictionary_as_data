Faitors, seems to be a French word antiquated or something traduced. For the modern French is (faiseur, i. factor) It is used in the Stat. A. 7. R. 2. cap. 5. And in the evil part signifying a bad doer. Or it may not improbably be interpreted an idle liver, taken from (faitardise) which signifies a kind of numb or sleepy disease, proceeding of too much sluggishness, which the Latins call (Veternus) for in the said Statute it seems to be a Synonymon to Vagabond.
