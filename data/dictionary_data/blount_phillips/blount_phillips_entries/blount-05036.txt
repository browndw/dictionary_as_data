Hypospadians or Hippospadians, a sort of monstrous persons that abuse themselves with a Horse or Mare. In Febr. 1652. one of these (who went by the name of Margaret Rain) was convict before the Judges at Edinborough in Scotland for some beastiality with a Horse or Mare; & both she and the Horse were burnt according to the Mosaical Law; this person by an Inquest of Chyrurgions, was found to be one of that sort (says the relation) whom the Philosophers call Hypospadians.
