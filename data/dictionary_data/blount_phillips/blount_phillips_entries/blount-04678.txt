Gryffen or Gryffon (Gryps) a strange Bird (as some ancient Authors affirm) with four feet, armed with cruel claws, being from the brest upward fashioned like an Eagle, but of purple colour, with red fiery eies, and whitish wings, and in the hinder part black, made much like a Lyon. This Bird nests in the high mountains, and is exceeding hard to be taken, except very young, for he will adventure on any man, and is so fierce, that he often kills Elephants; he is most enemy to horses; for which cause Virgil in his eighth Eclog. brings in the shepherd Damon, who wondred at a strange Marriage, speaking thus; Junguntur jam Gryphes Equisa
