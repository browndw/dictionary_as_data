Jupiter, the son of Saturn by his wife Ops, born at the same birth with Juno, and hid in the mountain Ida in Creet, where he was bred up by the Curetes unknown to his father Saturn, who intending to devoure all his male children, his wife Ops gave him a great stone wrapt up in swadling clouts, to eat instead of his son Jupiter, who coming to age and understanding his fathers designs against him, conspired against him, and cast him out of his dominions, and divided the government of the World between himself and his two brothers; the Heavens he reserved to himself, to Neptune he gave the Empire of the Sea, and to Pluto the lower Regions of the Earth.
