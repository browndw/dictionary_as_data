Warwick, the principal Town of Warwick-shire, which with much probability is judged to be the same with that, which anciently was called praesidium, i. a Garrison; for the Saxons, called it Warringwyck, the Brittains, Caer Ga cent arvick, both which words seem to have sprung from the Brittish word Guarth, which also signifieth a Garrison; here the Captain of the Dalmatian hors-men kept his residence, under the command of Dux Britanniae, this Town is situate over the River Avon, upon a steep Rock, fortified with strong walls, and a Castle toward the South-west.
