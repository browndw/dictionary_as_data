Baptism (from the Gr. Ba in non-Latin alphabet a, i. a washing with water, or diving over the head) is one of the Sacraments instituted by our Saviour Christ in remedy against Original sin in the Law of Grace, as Circumcision was the remedy against that sin in the Law of Moses. Before Christs institution of this Sacrament John Baptist did baptize unto penance, but his Baptism was not a Sacrament. In Authors you may read of three sorts of Baptism, which Divines call, Baptismus fluminis, of water, which is the already mentioned; Baptismus flaminis, of the Spirit, which is contrition of heart, with desire of the Sacrament of Baptism; And Baptismus sanguinis, of blood, which is martyrdom. The custom of the Primitive Church was to have God-Fathers and God-Mothers in the administration of the Sacrament of Baptism; their Office was not onely to be Witnesses of the Baptism, or to speak or answer for the baptized; but also to undertake a charge of instructing or seeing him instructed in the true Religion in due time.
