Laureat, (lat.) crowned with Laurel, or the bay-tree, which used to be worn by Conquerours in token of Triumph, also laureated letters, were letters wrapt up in Laurel or Bay-leaves, which the Roman Captains were wont to send unto the Senate, to give them notice of their Victories. This plant is said to be proof against thunder and liga cent tning.
