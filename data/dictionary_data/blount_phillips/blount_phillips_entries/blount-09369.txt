Scot and Lot (An. 33. H. 8. cap. 19.) signifies a customary contribution laid upon all Subjects after their ability. Scot comes from the Fr. Escot, i. symbolum, a shot. Rastal saith, 'tis a certain custom or common Tallage made to the use of the Sheriff or his Bayliff. Scot (says Camden) illud dicitur quod ex diversis rebus in unum acervum aggregatur. And in this sence it is still used; for when Good-fellows met at the Tavern or Alehouse, they at parting, call for a Shot, Scot, or Reckoning: And he is said to go Scot-free, that pays not his part or share towards it.
