Average (averagium) signifies service which the Tenant owes the Lord by horse or carriage of horse. It is also used for a certain Contribution that Merchants and others proportionably make towards their losses, who have their goods cast into the Sea, for the safeguard of the Ship or of the Goods and Lives of those in the Ship, in time of tempest: And this contribution seemes to bee so called, because it is proportioned after the rate of every mans average or goods carried.
