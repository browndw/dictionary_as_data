Tithing (Sax. Teothung) signifies (says Lambert) the number or company of ten men, with their families cast and knit together in a society, all of them being bound to the King, for the peaceable and good behavior of each of their society; of these companies there was one principal person, who of his office was called (Teothung-man) at this day in the West parts (Tithing-man) but now he is nothing but a Constable; for that old discipline of tithings is left long since. It also signifies a Court. An. 23. Ed 3. ca 4.
