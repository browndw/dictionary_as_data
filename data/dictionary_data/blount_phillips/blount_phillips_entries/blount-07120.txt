The Obsidional Crown (Corona obsidionalis) was given onely to him that relieved a City or Town besieged: This Crown was made of green Leaves, or of the Grass and Herbs of the same Field, where the enemy had been over-thrown, or forced to flight. The great Quintus Fabius received this Crown, for defending and delivering Rome from the siege of Hannibal.
