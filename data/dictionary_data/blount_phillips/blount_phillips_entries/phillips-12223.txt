Zodiack, one of the greater imaginary Circles, being 12 degrees in breadth, and 360 in length, and dividing the Sphere obliquely into two parts, and containeth the 12 Signs, which are called Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces, through the whole length of this Circle runneth a line just in the middle which is called the Ecliptick line, or the path-way of the Sun, because in that line the Sun performeth its course. The word Zodiack cometh from the Greek Zodioa cent , because of the representations of sundry animals which it containeth; in Latin it is called Signifer.
