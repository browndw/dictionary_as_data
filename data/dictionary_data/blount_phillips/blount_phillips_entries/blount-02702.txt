De ba cent ne ea cent sa cent , are three common Latin words, the meaning I conceive to be this; to take or do a thing de bene esse, is to accept or allow it as well done for present; but when it comes to be more fully examined or tried, it is to stand or fall, according to the merit or well being of the thing in its own nature; or as we say, valeat quantum valere potest. So in Chancery, upon motion to have one of the Defendants in a Cause, examined as a witness, the Court (not then precisely examining the Justice of it, or not hearing what may be objected on the other side) often orders a Defendant to be examined De bene esse, i. that his Depositions are to be allowed or suppressed at the Hearing, as the Judge shall see cause, upon the full debate of the matter; but for the present they have a well-being, or allowance.
