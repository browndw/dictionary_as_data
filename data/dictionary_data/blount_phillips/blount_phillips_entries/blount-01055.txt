Avoir-du-pois (Fr.) or Avoir-du-poix. i. habere pondus, or justi esse ponderis) to be of full or due weight: it signifies in our common Law two things: first, a kind of weight, divers from that called Troy weight, which contains but twelve ounces to the pound, whereas this contains sixteen. And in this respect it may probably be conjectured, to be so called, because it is of more weight then the other. Also it signifies such merchandize as are weighed by this weight, and not by Troy weight, as in the Statute of York, an. 9-E. 3. in Prooem. an. 27. Edw. 3. Stat. 2. ca. 10. & an. 2. Rich. 2. ca. 1. See weights.
