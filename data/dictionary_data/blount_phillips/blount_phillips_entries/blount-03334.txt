Ebionites (so called from Ebion their first founder, who lived in the time of Pope Anaclet, and the Emperor Titus about the year of Christ 71.) were certain Hereticks that denied the Divinity of our Saviour Christ, and held he was onely a man, conceived and born from man and woman, as the rest of mankind. Against which Heresie St. John wrote his Gospel; which they impugned and rejected, as they did also the Gospels of St. Mark and St. Luke, and onely admitted that of St. Matthew.
