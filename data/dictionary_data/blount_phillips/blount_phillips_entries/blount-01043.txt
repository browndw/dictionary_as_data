Answering Augustines, is a phrase used in Oxford where there was a Monastry of these Augustines, who were so eminent for their abilities in disputing, that the University did by a particular Statute, impose it as an exercise upon all those that were to proceed Masters of Art, that they should first be disputed upon by the Augusten-Friars; which old Statute is still in force, produced at this day for an equivalent exercise.
