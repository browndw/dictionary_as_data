Witchcraft, a certain evil Art, whereby with the assistance of the Devil, or evil Spirits, some wonders may be wrought, which exceed the common apprehension of men. It cometh from the Dutch word Wiechelen, i. to divine, or guesse; it is called in Latin Veneficium, in Greek Pharmaceia, i. the art of making poysons.
