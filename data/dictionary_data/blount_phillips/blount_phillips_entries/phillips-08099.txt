Myrmidons, a certain people of Thessaly, who went under the conduct of Achilles to the wars of Troy. They were so called from Myrmidon an ancient King of Thessaly the son of Jupiter and the Nimph Corymosa, or else from a certain Virgin called Myrmice, who for contemning Ceres, was changed into an Ant, from which there springing up a multitude of Ants, they were by the prayers of Aeacus, when Thessaly was almost depopulated, changed into men.
