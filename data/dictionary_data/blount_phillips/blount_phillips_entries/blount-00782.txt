Areopagite (areopagita) Judges of Life and Death among the Athenians, instituted by Solon; their custom was to use so much severity and integrity in judgment, that they heard all causes and matters in the night, to the end they might have no occasion to regard the parties, but onely have their eye and respect earnestly on the matter before them. They were called Areopagites from the Greek Areopagos, that is, Mars his street, a street in Athens so called, where they sate. St. Dionysius, converted to the Christian faith by St. Paul, was one of those Judges. Pol Virg.
