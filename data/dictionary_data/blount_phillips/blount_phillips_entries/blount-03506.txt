Emerald (from the Span. esmeralda, Lat. Smaragdus) a precious stone, the greenest of all other, and is therefore very comfortable to the sight. The best of this sort are brought out of Scythia, and some affirm them to be taken out of the Griffins nest. It is found by experience (as Albertus writes) that if the Emrald be good, it inclines the bearer to chastity, and cannot endure the action of lust. There is also a disease sounding near this word, for which see Hemorroide.
