Sea-Compass (pyxis Nautica) an instrument which Mariners use for their direction in Navigation; whereon are described the 32 Points or Winds; the Needle whereof (being in manner of a Flower de Luce) always points towards the North. About the year 1300 one Flavio of Melphi in Naples found out this Sea-Compass, consisting of eight a cent inds onely, the four principal, and four collateral; and not long after, the people of Bruges and Antwerp perfected that excellent invention, adding 24 other subordinate Winds or Points. Of this there are three kinds; the first, the plain Meridional Compass. The second, a Compass of Variation. The third, a Dark Compass.
