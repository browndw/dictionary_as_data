Iournal (Fr.) a Diary or Day-book. Also as much land as a Team of Oxen can plough in one day. In our times (says my Lord Bacon) Journals are in use only in Navigations and Expeditions of War; among the Antients it was a point of honor for Princes to have the Acts of their Court referred to Journals.
