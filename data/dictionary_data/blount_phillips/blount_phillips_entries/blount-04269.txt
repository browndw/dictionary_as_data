Folkmoote, is a Saxon word, compounded of Folk, i. populus, and Gemettan, i. convenire. It signifies (according to Mr. Lambert, in his exposition of Saxon words, verbo, conventus) two kinds of Courts, one now called the County Court, the other called the Sheriffs Turn. This word is still in use among the Londoners, and signifies Celebrem ex omni Civitate conventum. Stow. Surv. But Mr. Manwood in his first part of Forest Laws, p. 111, hath these words, Folkmote is the Court holden in London, wherein all the folk and people of the City did complain of the Mayor and the Aldermen for misgovernment within the City.
