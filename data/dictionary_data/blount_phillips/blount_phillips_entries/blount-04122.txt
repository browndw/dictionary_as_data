Felony (felonia) seems to come of the Fr. felonnie, i. impetuositas, atrocitas, immisericordia. We account any offence Felony that is in degree next to petty Treason, and compriseth divers particulars under it, as Murther, Theft, killing of a mans self, Sodomy, Rape, wilful burning of houses, and divers such like, which are to be gathered, especially out of Statutes, whereby many offences are daily made Felony, that before were not. Felony is discern'd from lighter offences, by this, that the punishment thereof is death; Howbeit Petit Larceny (which is the stealing of any thing under the value of twelve pence) is Felony, as appears by Brook. tit. Coron. n. 2. His reason is, because the Indictment against such a one must run with these words, felonicA cepit, and yet this is not punished by death, though it be loss of goods. A man may call that Felony, which is under petit Treason, and punished by death. And of this there are two sorts: one lighter, that for the first time may be relieved by Clergy; another that may not; and these are to be known by the Statutes; for Clergy is allowed where it is not expresly taken away.
