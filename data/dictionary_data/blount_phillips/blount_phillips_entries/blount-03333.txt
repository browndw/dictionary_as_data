Ebene (ebenus) a tree that grows in Aethiopia, bearing neither leaves nor fruit; it is black, and has no grain like other wood, and is sharp biting in taste, being burnt it yields a pleasant smell, neither is its smoak offensive, but the green wood is so full of sap, that it will flame like a candle. It is good against many diseases of the eyes. That which grows in India is spotted with white and yellow, being of less estimation then that of Aethiopia. Bull.
