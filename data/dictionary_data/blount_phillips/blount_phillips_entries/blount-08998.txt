Revels (from the Fr. Reveiller, i. to awake from sleep) are with us sports of Dancing, Masking, Comedies, and such like, still used in the Inns of Court, and Houses of some great Personages; and are so called, because they are performed by night; There is also an Officer, called, The Master of the Revels, who has the ordering and command of these pastimes.
