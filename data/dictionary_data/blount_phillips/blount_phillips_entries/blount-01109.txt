Babef (in Hebr. it signifies confusion) was an antient City of Chaldea in Mesopotamia, famous for the confusion of Languages, which there happened: For immediately after the universal Deluge, Nimrod the son of Chus, the son of Cham, perswaded the people (as some Authors surmise) to secure themselves from the like danger by building some stupendious Edifice, which might resist the fury of a second Deluge. This counsel was generally embraced, Heber onely and his family contradicting such an unlawful attempt; the major part prevailing, the Tower began to rear a head of majesty 5164 paces from the ground (says Isidore) having its basis and circumference equal to the height. But God beholding from high this fond attempt, sent among them (who before were one Language) a confusion of seventy two Tongues, which hindered the proceeding of this building, one not being able to understand what his fellow called for.
