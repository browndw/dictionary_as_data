Donatists, a Sect of Hereticks, so called from Donatus Bishop of Carthage, the first broacher of the Heresie, who lived about the year 358 in the time of Pope Liberius, and the Emperor Constantine. Their prime tenet was, that the true Church was onely in Africk, and that out of Africk there was no true Baptism; they held also that the Son in the mystery of the Blessed Trinity, was less then the Father, and the Holy Ghost less then the Son, with other damnable points, &c. See Circumcellians.
