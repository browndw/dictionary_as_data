Triumphant Arches, were among the Romans erected for them onely, who, having subdued whole Provinces or conquered foreign Nations, and obtained noble Victories, seemed worthy of triumph; and thereupon they were cal'd Triumphant Arches. Upon these Arches, for the perpetual memorial of acts atchieved, were engraven the portraiture of the very places, where the war was performed, the resemblances of Fabricks and ranged Battels, if the service was on land; and of Ships, if it were at sea; In Pliny's days they began first to be built, before, onely Statues and Trophees were set up, &c. Livie.
