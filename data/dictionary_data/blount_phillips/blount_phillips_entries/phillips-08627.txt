Othryades, a certain Lacedemonian, who in a combat of 300 Lacedemonians to 300 Argives, being the onely man of all his party left alive, put to flight those two who were the onely men left alive of the Argives, and writing upon his shield these words, I have overcome, he slew himself, as being ashamed to return to Sparta, all the rest of his companions being slain.
