Apennage Appennage (Fr.) the portion of the Kings younger Sons in France, a childs part. They have in France a fundamental Law, which they call the Law of Appennages, whereby the Kings younger Sons cannot have partage with the elder. This Law was made by Charlemain, before whose time France was dividable into as many Kingdoms as the King had Sons. By this Law the younger (though sometimes they are content with yearly Pensions) are to be entituled to some Dutchy, and all the Profits and Rights thereto appertaining; all matters of regality onely excepted, as Coinage, levying Taxes, and the like. It is derived from the German word Avanage, which signifies a portion. View of France.
