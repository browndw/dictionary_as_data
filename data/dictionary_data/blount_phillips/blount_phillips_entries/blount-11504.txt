Woolwinders, are such as winde up Fleeces of Wool, to be pack'd and sold by weight, into a kind of bundle, after it is cleansed as it ought to be by Statute. And to avoid such deceipt, as the owners were wont to use, by thrusting in Locks of refuse Wool, and such other dross to gain weight, they are sworn to perform that Office truly between the owner and the Merchant. See the Statute of 8. H. 6. c. 22.23 H. 8. c. 17. And 18 Eliz. c. 25.
