Licence to arise, in Common Law, is a liberty given by the Court to a tenant that is essoynd de malo lecti in a reall action, after he hath been viewed by Knights thereunto appointed, until which time, if the Demandant can prove that he hath been seen out of his chamber, or walking up and down his grounds, he shall be adjudged to be deceitfully essoyned.
