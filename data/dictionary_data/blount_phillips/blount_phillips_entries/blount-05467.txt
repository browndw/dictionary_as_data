Injunction (injunctio) is a Writ issuing out of the Chancery; sometimes to give possession to the Plaintiff, for want of the Defendants appearance; sometimes to stay proceeding in a Cause at Common Law upon suggestion made, that the rigor of the Law, if it take place, is against equity and conscience in that case. See West. part. 2. Symb. tit. Proceeding in Chancery. Sect. 25.
