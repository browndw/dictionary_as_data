Knight Baronet, is a new distinct Order erected by King James, who for certain disbursements toward the Plantation in Vlster, created divers into this Dignity, and made it hereditary by his Letters Patents to be seen in the Rolles, whereas before that time there were Baronets who were not Knights, and these Knight Baronets were to have precedency in all Writings, Sessions, and Salutations, before all Knights of the Bath, and Knights Bachelours, and Bannerets, except those created under the Kings Standard in an Army Royal, the King being personally present, and the King was not to create any person into that degree of Baronet within the Kingdom of England, above the number of two hundred.
