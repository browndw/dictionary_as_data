Assumpsit (the third person of the Preterfect Tense of the Verb assumo, i.e. to take to or upon ones self) is a voluntary promise made by word, whereby a man assumes or takes upon him to perform or pay any thing to another. This word contains any Verbal Promise made upon consideration; for a promise without consideration will not in Law bind to performance, but is called, nudum pactum ex quo non oritur actio.
