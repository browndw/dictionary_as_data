Solstice (solstitium, quasi Solis statio) the Sun-stead or stay, when it can neither go higher nor lower, which is in Summer about mid June, when the days are at the longest, and in Winter about mid December, when they are at the shortest; at which time the Sun comes to the Tropick of Capricorn, and in June to that of Cancer. It is most commonly taken for Midsummer; and Mid-winter is termed Bruma.
