Amazons (amazones) warlike women of Scythia, that had but one Teat (their name in Greek importing as much) they were very manlike, and did cut off their right Breast, that it might not hinder their shooting, for they were excellent Archers; they lived by themselves, and if at any time they went to their Husbands or neighboring men, and conceived; if it were a Female childe they kept it; if a Male, they sent it to the Father: the Country where they live is denominated from them, and called Amazonia.
