Apprentice (Fr. Apprenti, and that from apprendre, to learn, whence their Apprentisage, and our Apprentiship) is such a person, who serves a certain time (for the most part seven years) by pact, for the learning of any Art. In former time Barristers were called Apprentices to the Law. As appears by Mr. Seldens notes on Fortescu, p. 3. So the learned Plowden stiled himself; and Mr. Hen. Finch in his Nomotechnia writes himself Apprentice del Ley.
