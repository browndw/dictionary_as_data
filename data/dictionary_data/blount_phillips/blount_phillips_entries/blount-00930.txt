Assets (from the French Assez, i. satis) signifies in our Common Law, goods enough to discharge that burden, which is cast upon the Executor or Heir, in satisfying the Testators or Ancestors Debts or Legacies. See Brook, titulo, Assets per discent: By whom you shall learn, that whosoever pleads Assets, saith nothing, but that he against whom he pleads, hath enough descended or come into his hands, to discharge that which is in demand. The Author of the new Terms of Law makes two sorts of Assets. Viz. Assets par discent, and enter mains, the former being to be alledged against an heir, the other against an Executor or Administrator.
