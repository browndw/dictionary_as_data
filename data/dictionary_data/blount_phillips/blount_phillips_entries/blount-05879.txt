Lapse (lapsus) a fall, sliding, or a slip. In our Laws it is a slip or departure of a right of presenting to a void Benefice, from the original Patron, neglecting to present within six moneths to the Ordinary; For we say that Benefice is in lapse or lapsed, whereunto he that ought to present, hath omitted or slipped his opportunity. Ann. 13. Eliz. cap. 12. &c.
