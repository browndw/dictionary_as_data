Sewer or Sewar, has two significations, one applied to him that ushers or comes in before the meat of the King or other great Personage, and placeth it on the Table, &c. The other, to such passages or gutters, as carry water into the Sea or River, in Lawyers Latin called Sewera, A. 6. H. 6. c. 5. And there are Commissions of Sewers usually granted under the Great Seal, authorising certain persons, to see Dreins and Ditches well kept and maintained in the Marish and Fen Countries, for better conveyance of the water into the Sea, and preserving the grass for food of Cattle. This word is probably derived from the Fr. (issue) an issue or going forth, as if we should call them Issuers, because they give issue or passage to the water, &c. And the Latin word (suera) sometimes used in these Commissions, is a competent reason for this conjecture. See Fitz. nat. br. in Oyer and Terminer. I have heard of an old French book containing the Officers of the King of Englands Court as it was antiently governed, wherein, he whom we now call Sewer, was called Asseour, which comes from the Fr. (Asseoir) to settle or place, wherein his Office in setting down the meat is well expressed. And Sewer, as it signifies such an Officer, is by Fleta Latined Assessor, a setter down, lib. 2. ca. 15.
