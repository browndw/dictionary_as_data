Quid pro quo, is an artificial speech in our Common Law, signifying as much as the Greek a in non-Latin alphabet a, among the Civilians, which is a mutual Protestation or performance of both parties to a Contract; as a Horse and Ten pound, between the buyer and seller. Kitch. fol. 184. And used in our common speech, One for another; as to render one Quid proquo, i. to give him as good as he brings. And is used by Apothecaries, when, instead of one thing they use another of the same nature.
