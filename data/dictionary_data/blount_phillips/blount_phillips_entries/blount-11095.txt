Sin is either original or actual; the first is a privation of original justice, which we inherit from our first parent Adam, being all by course of nature conceived and born in that privation or original sin; The latter is a thought, word or deed contrary to the Law of God and this Actual sin is, by many Divines, divided into mortal and venial; Mortal sin they account any great offence against the charity of God or our neighbour, and to be so called, because it kills the soul; and robs it of the spiritual life of grace; Venial sin, is any small and pardonable offence against God or our neighbour, as the stealing an apple or a pin; an idle word or such like.
