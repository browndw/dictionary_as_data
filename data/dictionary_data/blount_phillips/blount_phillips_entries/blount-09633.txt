Simony (simonia) the buying or selling of Church Livings, or other spiritual things for mony. It first took denomination from Simon Magus, a Sorcerer of Samaria, who offered money to the Apostles, that he might have power to give the Holy Ghost to any he should lay his hands on, for which attempt he was sharply reproved by St. Peter.
