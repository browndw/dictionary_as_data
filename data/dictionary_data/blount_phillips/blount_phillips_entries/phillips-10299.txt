Salacity, (lat.) wantonnesse, or inclination to Venery, perhaps from Salacia a goddesse of the water, whom the ancients held to be the wife of Neptune, and that she caused the fluctuation, or moving up and down of the Sea; also the Ebbing and flowing of the Sea was called by the Romans in old time Salicia and Venilia.
