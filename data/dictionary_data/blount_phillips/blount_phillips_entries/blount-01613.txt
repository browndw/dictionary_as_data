Carol, A Christmas song, or Hymn in honor of our Saviours birth; it comes from Cantare, i. to sing, and Rola an interjection expressing joy; for heretofore in the burden of delightful songs, and when men were jocound, they were wont to sing Rola, Rola, as sometimes they now do, Hey down, derry derry. It was an antient custom among the Christians in their Feasts, to bring every one into the midst, and incite him to sing unto God, as well as he could, either out of holy Scriptures, or out of his own wit and invention. Tertul. lib. adv. Gentes, cap. 39.
