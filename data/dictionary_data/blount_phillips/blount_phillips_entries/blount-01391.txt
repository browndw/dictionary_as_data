Brodehalfpenny (Sax.) signifies a Toll or Custom for setting up Tables or Bords in a Fair or Market, from which they that are freed by the Kings Charter, had this word mentioned in their Letters Patents. Insomuch, as at this day the freedom it self (for shortness of speech) is called Brodehalfpenny.
