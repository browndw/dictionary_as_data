In Astronomy there are five such imagined lines, running circle-wise about the round compass of the Heavens. The first is the Aequinoctial Line, just in the middle of the World, between the two Poles. The second northward from the Aequinoctial, is the Tropick of Cancer, to which sign the Sun comes about the eleventh day of June. The third (yet more northward) is the northern Circle, within twenty three degrees and fifty minutes of the North Pole. The fourth Line is the Tropick of Capricorn, declining southward from the Aequinoctial, as much as the Tropick of Cancer doth northward, and to this Line the Sun comes about the twelfth of December. The fifth and last Line, is the Southern Circle, being as near the South Pole, as the Northern Circle (before spoken of) is to the North Pole. These Parallels are also called Aequidistants. There is another sort of Parallels (two of which go to a Clime) called Artificial Parallels, because they shew the differences of artificial days, &c. Heyl.
