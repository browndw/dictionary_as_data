Distress (districtio) signifies most commonly in our Law, a compulsion in certain real Actions whereby to bring a man to appearance in Court, or to pay debt, or duty denied. The effect whereof most usually is, to drive the party distrained to Replieve the distress, and so to take his action of trespass against the distrainer, or else to compound neighborly with him for the debt or duty for which he distrains; In what cases a distress is lawfull, See The new terms of Law, Verbo distresse. Sometimes it signifies great affliction or misery.
