Maniple (manipulus) a gripe, a handful, a bundle; But more particularly, it is a Fannel or Scarf-like ornament worn about the lest Wrist of of a sacrificing Priest. Also a file of ten Soldiers under one Captain and Tent; so called because their handstrokes in fighting went together; Or because they fought sub eodem manipulo foeni (an handful of hay being used at that time instead of a flag.) Ovid.
