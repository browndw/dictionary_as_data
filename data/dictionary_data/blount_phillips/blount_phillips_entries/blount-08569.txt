Pygmies (Pygmaei) a Dwarfish people in the uttermost Mountains oi India, in height not passing one cubit, their women bring forth children at Five years, and at Eight are accounted old. Fame goes, that they have continual war with Cranes, by whom they are often worsted, &c. But Dr. Brown in his Vul. Err. chap. 21. with good reason, makes doubt whether there are or ever were any such creatures.
