Declension, or Declination, (lat.) a declining or bowing down; also in Grammar, it signifieth the varying of Cases and Tenses in Nounes and Verbs. In Astrology, the declination of a Planet is his distance from the equator, and as he declines from thence, either northward or southward, so is his declination nominated either north or south.
