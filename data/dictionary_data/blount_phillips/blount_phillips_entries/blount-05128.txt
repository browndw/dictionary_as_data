Ignis Fatuus (Lat.) foolish fire, or (as the Country people call it) Will of the Wisp, is a certain viscous substance, reflecting light in the dark, evaporated out of a fat earth, and flying in the air. It commonly haunts Church-yards, Privies and Fens, because 'tis begotten out of fatness; it flyes about Rivers, Hedges, &c. because in those places there is a certain flux of air; it follows one that flyes it, and flyes one that follows it; because the air doth so. Per. Instit. It is called Ignis fatuus, because it onely feareth fools. Hence 'tis, when men are led away with some idle fancy or conceit, we use to say an Ignis fatuus hath done it.
