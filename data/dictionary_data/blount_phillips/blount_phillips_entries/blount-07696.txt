Pelagia cent ns, an antient sort of Hereticks, who (among other damnable Tenets) taught that man of his own free-will might without the Grace of God, keep the Commandments, and merit eternal life, &c. This Heresie took name from Pelagius its first brocher, and was condemned by a general Council held in the Island of Malta, by P. Innocent the first, at which St. Austin was present, and 214 Bishops.
