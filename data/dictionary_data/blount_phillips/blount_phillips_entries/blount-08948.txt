Respite or Respight of Homage (respectus Homagii) was the forbearing of Homage which ought first of all to be performed by the Tenant, that held by Homage; which Respite was paid upon divers good reasons, but most frequently by such as held by Knights service in Capite; who because the Prince could not be at leisure to take their Homage, did pay into the Exchequer, every fifth term, some small sum of money for respite till the Prince might be at leasure to take it in person. This is now abrogated, with the Court of Wards, by Act 1656. c. 4.
