Lauds (laudes) praises; but more particularly, they are a part of those prayers used by Roman Catholicks, called our Ladies Office, or of the Priests Office, which is between the Nocturns and the Hours. They are called Lauds from the Psalms, Laudate Dominum de coelis, &c. and Laudate Dominum in sanctis ejus, &c. therein contained, &c. Vide Primer.
