With us in England, a load of Wooll (as I have been enformed) consists of eighty Tod, each Tod consisting of two stone, and each stone of fourteen pound. And that a Sack of wooll is in common account equal with a load; and a Sarplar (otherwise called a Pocket) is half a Sack: Further, that a Pack of Wooll is a Hors-load, which consists of seventeen stone, and two pounds; see Fleta lib. 2. c. 12.
