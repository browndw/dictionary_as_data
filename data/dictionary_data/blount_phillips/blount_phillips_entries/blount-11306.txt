Vle, Yeule, Yool or Vle-Games, in our Northern parts, are taken for Christmass games or sports; from the Fr. NouAle. But Dr. Hammond thinks Yule should be taken immediately from the Lat. Jubilum, as that signifies a time of rejoycing or festivity, &c. See his Answer to six Quaeries, p. 464. But Mr. Sumner more probably derives it from the Sax. Gehul, i. natalis domini, Christmas. In Yorkshire &c our other Northern parts, they have an old custom, after Sermon or Service on Christmas day, the people will, even in the Churches cry AEle, AEle, as a token of rejoycing, and the common people run about the streets singing Vle, Vle, Vle,Three puddings in a Pule,Crack nuts and cry Vle.
