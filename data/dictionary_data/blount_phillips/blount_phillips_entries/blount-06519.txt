Mermaid (from the Fr. Mer, the Sea) or Maremaid (from mare, the Sea) Seamaid, or Siren, whereof the Poets had three, Parthenope, Leucosia and Ligaea; the first used her voyce, the second a Citern, the third a Pipe; and so are said to entice Mariners and Seamen to them, by the sweetness of their musick, and then to destroy them. The upper part of their bodies, was like a beautiful Virgin, the neather was fishy. By these Sirens, pleasures are emblematically understood, from which unless a man abstain, or at least use moderately, he shall be devoured in their waves. See Neriad and Sirens.
