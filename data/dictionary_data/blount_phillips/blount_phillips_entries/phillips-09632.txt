Proserpina, the daughter of Jupiter and Ceres, she being ravisht by Pluto, was sought for by Ceres all over the earth, but after the whole matter was related by the Nymph Cyane, Jupiter at her earnest request, granted that her daughter should return again to earth, on condition she had tasted no meat since she came to Hell, but Ascalaphus having declared that she had eaten part of a Pomegranate (for which Ceres turned him into an Owl) she could obtain no more, but that she should be 6 moneths upon earth, and 6 moneths with Pluto.
