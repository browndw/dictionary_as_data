Maundy Thursday (the last Thursday in Lent, and next before Easter) so called as it were, Mandati Thursday, from a ceremony, used by the Bishops and Prelates in Cathedral Churches and Religious Houses, of washing their Subjects feet; which ceremony is termed the fulfilling the Mandate, and is in imitation of our Saviour Christ, who on that day at night after his last Supper, and before his institution of the Blessed Sacrament, washed his Disciples feet, telling them afterwards that they must do the like to one another: this is the Mandate, whence the day is nominated. At the beginning of the aforesaid ceremony, these words of Christ (uttered by him soon after his washing their feet) John. 13.34. are sung for an Antiphon. Mandatum novum do vobis, ut diligatis invicem, sicut dilexi vos. I give you a new Mandate, &c.
