Publican (publicanus) he that farms or collects the common Rents and Revenues of the King or People One who bought or farmed (by great) the Emperors Tribute. It was an odious name among the Jews, because they were commonly men of ill conscience, that exercised that Office. See Moses and Aaron, p. 6.
