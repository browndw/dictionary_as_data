Whitsuntide, as it were the time of the white son; also Whitsunday seemeth to signify as much as sacred Sunday; from the Saxon word Wihed, i. sacred, being a certain feast celebrated, in memory of the holy Ghost, descending upon the Apostles in fiery tongues; it is called in Greek Pentecost, as being the 50th. day from the Resurrection.
