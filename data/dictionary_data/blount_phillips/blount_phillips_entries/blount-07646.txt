Paunage (from the Fr. panage or pasnage) signifies, in our Common Law, the money taken by the Agistors for feeding Hogs with the Mast of the Kings Forest. Cromp. Juris. fol. 165. Agistment (says Manwood) is properly the common of herbage of any kind of ground, Land or Woods, or the money due for the same; and Pawnage is most properly the Mast of the Woods or Hedgerowes, or the money arising by it. Mr. Skene calls it Pannagium, and defines it to be the Duty given to the King for the pasturage of Swine in the Forest.
