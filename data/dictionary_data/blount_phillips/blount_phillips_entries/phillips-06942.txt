Lammas day, the first of August, so called, as some say, because the Priests, on this day, were wont to gather their Tithe-Lambs, others take it from the Saxon word Laffmess, i. Breadmass, it being kept as a feast of Thanks-giving for the first fruits of the Corn, it is also called Gule, or Yule of August, see Gule of August.
