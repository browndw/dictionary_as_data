Annihilate (annihilo) is the opposite to creation; as to create, is to make something of nothing, or to produce an effect without the help of precedent materials: so to annihilate is utterly to destroy or to reduce something to its old nothing; and as to create is an action proper onely to God himself, so in like manner to annihilate is onely proper to Him, whereas other kinds of productions and corruptions are the ordinary effects of sublunary and second Causes.
