Scylla, the daughter of Nysus, King of Megara, which being besieged by Minos, King of Creet was betrayed into his hands by Scylla, who falling in love with Minos, cut off her fathers purple lock (upon which the fate of the Citie depended) and sent it to him; but afterwards seeing her self despised, and dying for grief, she was turned into a Partridge, and Nisus into a Hawk; also the daughter of Phorcus, who falling in love with Glaucus, was envied by Circe, who poisoning the water wherein she used to bath her self, the lower part of her body became altogether like the grinning of Dogs; whereupon she threw her self headlong down the next praecipice, and was transformed to a Rock over against Charybdis.
