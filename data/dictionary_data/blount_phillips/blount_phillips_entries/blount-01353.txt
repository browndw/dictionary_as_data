Bote or Boote is an old Saxon word, and signifies help, succour, aide and advantage; coming from the Low-Dutch Boete, Baete, which is amends, remedy, and help; so we may say what boots or avails it? or what boot will you give me? and is commonly joyned with other words, as Bridg-boot, Burgh-boot, Fire-boot, Hedge-boot, and divers others.
