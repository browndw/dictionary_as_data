Cabala, Kabala, or Cabalistick are, a hidden Science of Divine Mysteries, which consists in drawing several senses either out of the same letters of a Hebrew word, as they lye first written in the word, or by different combinations of them, or by changing one letter for another according to art, or from the different writing a letter in one word, from the writing of the same letter in another word, or yet by some other nice ways, known to the Hebrew Rabbins, who onely use this Art for their Exposition of Scripture; And as it is an Art proper to the Jews, so is it judged by the better learned, to contain more of the imaginary, or phantastical, then of solid learning, towards the true understanding of holy Scripture. See Moses and Aaron, p. 169.
