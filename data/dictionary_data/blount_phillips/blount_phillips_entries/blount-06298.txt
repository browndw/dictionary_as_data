Mancuse (mancusa) of the antient pence (which weighed about three pennies of our money) thirty (as Alfric Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, in his Saxon Grammer, notes) made a Mancus, which some think to be all one with a Mark; for that Manca, or Mancusa is translated in antient Books, by Marca; and Manca (as appears by an old fragment) was quinta pars unciae. These Mancuse or Mancus were reckoned both in gold and silver. For about the year of our Lord 680. In a King of the West Saxons, as we read in Malmsbury, enforced the Kentish men to redeem their peace at thirty thousand Manca's of gold. In the notes upon Canutus Laws, I find this difference, that Mancusa was as much as a Mark of silver, and Manca was a square piece of gold commonly valued at thirty pence. Cam. Rem. fo. 181.
