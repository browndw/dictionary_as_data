Opium (Lat.) or Opiate, the juyce of black Poppy, sold dry by Apothecaries. It is sometimes used in Physick to cause sleep, or to asswage excessive pain, but then it must be mixed with other things, and given with great discretion; for, taken alone, it will cast one into a deadly sleep; being cold and dry in the fourth degree.
