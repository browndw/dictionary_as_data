Iconoclast (Gr.) a demolisher or breaker of Images; also a Sect so called, sprung up about the year of Christ 719 in time of Pope Gregory the second, and Leo the third Emperor, who, for casting holy Images and Statues out of the Churches, and causing them to be burnt or broken, was surnamed the Iconoclast or Iconomachus. Against which was gathered the seventh Nicene Synod consisting of 350. Bishops, who decreed against, and condemned it for heresie, &c.
