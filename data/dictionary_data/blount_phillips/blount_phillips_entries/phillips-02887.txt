Consideration, (lat.) an advising or taking heed; also a term in Common law, signifying the material part of a contract, without which no contract standeth or bindeth. Consideration is either expressed, as when a man bargaineth to give a certain sum for any thing, or else imply'd as when the law inforceth a consideration.
