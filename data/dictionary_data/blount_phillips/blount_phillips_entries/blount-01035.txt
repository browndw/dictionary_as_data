Augury (augurium) a divination, foretelling or Sooth-saying of things to come, by the chirping, flying, voyces or sitting of Birds: The Professors whereof (called Augures) were of great account among the Heathen Romans, insomuch that there was a Colledge of them in the City, neither would the Romans undertake any publick matter of importance without asking their assent. But the vanity thereof was well derided by a wise Jew, named Mossolamus, as Josephus writes: For an Augur in the Wars once requiring that the Army which was then marching might stand still a while, till he took observation of a Bird, thereby to foreknow the success of that Expedition, this Jew (whilst the Augur was busie in his art) shot at the bird with an arrow, and by chance killed her; whereat the Augur and others being highly offended; Are you so foolish (quoth the Jew) to imagine this poor Bird can tell what will happen to us, that could not foresee her own death so near at hand? They were called Augures, ab avium garritu, from the chirping and chattering of Birds. The Egyptians were the first inventers of this Diabolical superstition.
