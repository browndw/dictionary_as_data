Firmament, (from the Latin Firmus, i. e. solid.) the starry Heaven, it is turned about the Chrystalline Heaven, being both of an uniform motion, & finish their course in 250000 years, which motion appears not, but by the observation of sundry ages. For 430 years before Christs time, the first star in Aries was in the vernal intersection, which still keeps that name, though now removed almost 29 degrees, so that in more then two thousand years the fixed stars have not travelled from VVest to East, so much as one whole sign of the Zodiack.
