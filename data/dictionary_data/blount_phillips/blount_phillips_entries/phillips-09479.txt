Prender, a word used in Common Law, things which lie in prender are those things which the Lord of a Manour may have before atturnment, as the ward of the body of an heir, or of the land escheats; whereas those things which lie in Render he cannot take before atturnment; as rents, releifs, heriots, &c.
