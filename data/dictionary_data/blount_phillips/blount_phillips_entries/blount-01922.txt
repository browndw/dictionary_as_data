Circumcision (circumcisio) a cutting about, or making incision; And to speak more properly, it is a cutting away a part of the prepuce and double skin, which covered the head or extremity of Virga virilis, which was performed with a sharp cutting stone, and not with any knife of iron steeled, &c. It was a ceremony prescribed by God to Abraham and his posterity, heirs of the divine promises (Genesis 17.) and commanded to be observed by them, under pain of death, as a sign and seal of the Covenant betwixt God and them, and as a distinctive mark of them from all other people.
