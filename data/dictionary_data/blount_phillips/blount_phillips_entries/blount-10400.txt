After the suppression of these Templars, their lands were (by a general Council held at Vienna) conferred on the other more antient and religous Knights of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, called also Joannites, and after Knights of Rhodes, and lastly of Malta, where they live at this day. And this Cannon of the Council was confirmed to the Knights of Saint John residing here in England by Act of Parliament made 17. Ed. 2. In the reign of Edw. 3, (after several noble persons had in this interval been tenants and occupants of the Temple Inns) certain of the reverend antient Professors of the Laws obtained a very large or perpetual Lease of this Temple, or of two parts thereof, distinguished by the names of the Middle and Inner Temple, from the said Joannites (then residing in their goodly house called the Priory of St. John of Jerusalem, near Smithfield) to pay yearly ten pounds.
