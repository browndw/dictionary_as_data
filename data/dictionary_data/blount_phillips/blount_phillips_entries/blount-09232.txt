Besides this great Sanhedrim called, Sanhedrim Gedola, the Jews had two lesser or inferior to it; the one consisting of three Judges; to the Examination and Decision of which Court, the most petty actions were subject; As private Quarrels, Thefts and the like; this they called by words of their Language, signifying, Domus judicii trium virum, The Court of three Judges. The other consisted of twenty and three, and so was termed, Domus judicii viginti trium, to whose Court belonged the Decision of weightier Sutes and capital Causes.
