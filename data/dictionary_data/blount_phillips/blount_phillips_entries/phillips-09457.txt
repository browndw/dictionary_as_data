Praedicable, Praedicament, and Praedicate, (lat.) three words which are most commonly used as terms in Logick, Praedicables (which are 5. viz. genus, species, proprium, differentia, and accidens) are those things which may truly, naturally, and immediately, be affirmed of more things than one. Praedicaments (which are also called Categories, and are 10 in all, viz. Substance, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Action, Passion, Where, When, Situation, and Habit) are the Series of things gradually disposed under the same summum genus. A Praedicate is the last part of the Proposition or the major term of a Syllogisme.
