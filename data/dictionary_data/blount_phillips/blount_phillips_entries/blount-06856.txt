Naif (Fr.) lively, quick, natural, kindly, proper, no ways counterfeit. Jewellers when they speak of a Diamond that is perfect in all its properties, as in the water, shape, cleanness, &c. say tis a Naif stone; others account a Naif stone to be one that is found growing naturally in such perfection, as if it had been artificially cut, and therefore most esteemed.
