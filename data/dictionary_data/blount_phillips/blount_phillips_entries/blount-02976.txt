The Grecians had five especial Dialects. As 1. The property of speech in Athens, called the Attick Dialect, which was most copious and fittest for eloquence. 2. The Ionick, which the antient Writers most used. 3. The a cent orick. 4. The Aeolick, or Bucolic, fittest for Poets. 5. The common. Heyl. So every Country commonly hath in divers parts of it some difference of language, which is called the Dialect or Sub-dialect of the place.
