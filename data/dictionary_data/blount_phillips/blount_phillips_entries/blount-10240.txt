Symbole (symbola) a token, badge, or sign to know one by, a secret and mystical note; a short and intricate riddle or sentence; also an uniform concurrence of divers opinions; also the sum of our belief, the Creed. Many frauds you shall read in Plautus, plotted and acted by counterfeiting, and slie conveyance of these Symbols or tokens, wherein there was ever some image or other. So the Symbol of Amphytrion in that Tragicomedy was Sol cum quadrigis, the Sun in his Chariot drawn with four horses. Pyrgopolinices the bragging Soldier, had his own lovely self with great decorum drawn in his Signet for a Symbol.
