Obelisk (obeliscus) a great square stone broad beneath, and waxing smaller towards the top. There were divers of these in Egypt consecrated in honor of the Sun; whereof four were principally erected by King Sochis, of wonderful height; many Obelisks were likewise at Rome in time of the Roman Emperors. The difference between an Obeliske and a Pyramid was this; the Obelisk was all of one entire stone or piece, and therefore of no such height as the Pyramids, which were of divers stones; and again the Obelisk is four-square, whereas the Pyramis may be of other figure.
