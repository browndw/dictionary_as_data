Fifteenth (Decima quinta) is a Tribute or Imposition of money laid upon every City, Burrough, and other Town through the Realm, not by the Poll, or upon this or that man, but in general upon the whole City or Town; so called because it amounts to one fifteenth part of that which the City or Town hath been valued at of old.
