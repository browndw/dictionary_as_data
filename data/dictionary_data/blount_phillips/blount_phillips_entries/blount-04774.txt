Headborow is compounded of two words (Heosed, i. caput) and Borhe, i. pignus) and signifies him that is chief of the Frank pledge: And him that had the principal Government of them within his own pledge. And as he was called Headborow, so was he also called Burow-head, Thirdborow, Burshoulderz Tithingman, Chief Pledge or Burrow-Elder, according to the diversity of speech in divers places. Of this see Mr. Lamberts Explication of Centuria, and his Treatise of Constables, and Smith de Repub. Ang. l. 2. ca. 22. It now signifies Constable.
