Romance (Span.) a feigned History, either in Verse or Prose in the Vulgar Language; the first news we heard of this word, was from a Poem writ in French, by John Clopinel alias Meung, entituled Le Roman de la Rose, and afterward translated into English by Chaucer; but we now give the name Romance most commonly to a feigned History writ in Prose.
