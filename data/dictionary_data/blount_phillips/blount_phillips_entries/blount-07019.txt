Notary (notarius) a Scribe or Scrivener, that onely takes notes, or makes a short draught of contracts, obligations or other instruments; these notes he may deliver to the parties that gave him instructions, if they desire no more; but if they do, he must deliver them to a Tabellion, who draws them at large, ingrosses them in parchment, &c. and keeps a Register of them, but this is not generally observed; for in many Towns of France, the Notaries are also Tabellions.
