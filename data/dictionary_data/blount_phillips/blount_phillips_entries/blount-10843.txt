Trope (Gr. Tropos, i. verborum immutatio) is when a word is drawn from its proper and genuine signification to another. The difference between a Trope and a Figure is this; the first relates to particular words onely, the other concerns many words or the whole frame of a sentence. The last most commonly uses words elegantly in their native signification, the other contrarywise.
