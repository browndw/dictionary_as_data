Synagogue (from the Gr. a in non-Latin alphabet a, to gather together) commonly taken for a house (among the Jews) dedicated to the worship of God, wherein it was lawful to pray, preach, and dispute, but not to sacrifice. In Hebrew it was called Beth Harneseth, the house of Assembly. The Temple of Hierusalem was as the Cathedral Church; the Synagogues, as petty Parish Churches belonging thereto.
