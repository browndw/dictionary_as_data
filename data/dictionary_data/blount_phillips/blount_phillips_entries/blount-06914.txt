Neophyte (neophytus) any thing lately planted or set; one newly entred into any profession, most commonly taken for one lately converted to the faith. The Neophyte or new Convert (says Mr. Gregory, p. 111.) received a Taper lighted, from the Mystagogus; which for the space of seven days after, he was to hold in his hand at Divine Service, sitting in the Baptistery.
