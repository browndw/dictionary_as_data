Commendam (commenda) is, when a Benefice (being void) is commended to the charge and care of some sufficient Clerk, to be supplied, till it may be conveniently provided of a Pastor. In which case we use to say, such a one hath it in Commendam. And that this was the true original of this practise, you may read at large in Duarenus de Sacris Ecclesiae Ministeriis & Beneficiis l. 5. c. 7.
