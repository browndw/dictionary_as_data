Laomedon, a King of the Trojans, he was the son of Ilus, and the father of Priamus, to divert a great pestilence which was sent upon the City, because he had defrauded Neptune and Apollo of the wages he had promised them for building the City walls, he was constrained to expose his daughter Hesione to be devoured by a Sea-monster, promising Hercules to give him his horses which were of sacred race, on condition he would undertake to free his daughter, which he having performed, and Laomedon going back from his word, Hercules made war against him, and took the City, slew Laomedon, took Priamus captive, and gave Hesione to Telamon, who was the first man that skalled the walls.
