Ephod (Hebr.) a Priestly Garment, used antiently to be worn by the Priests among the Jewes, whereof there were two kinds. The first was made of gold and twisted silk, of purple, scarlet, and violet colour, and fine linnen with broidered work, and this onely belonged to the High Priest, and was onely used by him, when he executed his function: it covered the back, and the breast; and on the shoulders there were set two great precious Onyx stones, and in them graven the names of the twelve Sons of Jacob, called the twelve Patriarchs; in the right shoulder the six eldest, and in the left the six youngest; that the High Priest going into the Sanctum Sanctorum, to officiate, might among other things be put in mind he was to pray to God for the posterity of those twelve Patriarchs.
