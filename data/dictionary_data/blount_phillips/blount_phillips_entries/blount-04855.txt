Hesperides, the daughters of Hesperus, brother to Atlas, called Aegle, Arethusa and Hesperethusa: They had Gardens and Orchards, that bore golden fruit, kept by a vigilant Dragon, which Hercules slew, and robbed the Orchard. From this story, we find often mention of the Gardens and Apples of Hesperides.
