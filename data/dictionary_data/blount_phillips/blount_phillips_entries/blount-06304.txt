Mandrake or Mandrage (from the Gr. a in non-Latin alphabet a, i. a Den or Hole, because it useth to grow about Dens or Caves) a strange plant bearing yellow round apples, the root of it is great and white like a Radish root, and is divided into two or more parts, growing sometimes like the legs of a man. This root, especially its bark, is extreamly cold and dry, even to the fourth degree. It is therefore very dangerous to receive inwardly, for that the least quantity too much, will quickly kill a man. Chyrurgeons use to steep this root in wine, and give it to be drunk by such as they must cut, saw, or burn in any part; for its cold operation causeth sleep, and maketh the body insensible for a time. See the confutation of many false conceptions concerning this plant Mandrake, in Dr. Br. Vul. Er. l. 2. ca. 6.
