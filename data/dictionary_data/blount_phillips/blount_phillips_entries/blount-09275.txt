Saturn (Saturnus) hath the first place among the Planets, but is slowest in motion, not finishing its course under thirty eight years space. The antient Mathematicians attributed Sterility and Mortality, to this Planet; to Jupiter, happy times, and the beginning of life; To Mars, the cause of all Debates, Garboils, and War; To Sol, Riches and Treasure; To Venus, Loves and Marriages; To Mercury, Eloquence and Knowledge; To Luna, the Empire and command over Humid matters.
