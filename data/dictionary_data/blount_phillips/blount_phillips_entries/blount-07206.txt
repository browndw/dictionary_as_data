Olla podrida, a Hotchpot of several ingredients; Mr. Howel, in one of his Letters describes it thus. The Olla podrida hath Intellectuals and Sences: Mutton, Beef, and Bacon, are to her as the Will, AEnderstanding and Memory are to the Soul; Cabbage, Turnips, Artichocks, Potatoes, and Dates, are her five Sences, and Pepper the common Sence: She must have Marrow to keep life in her, and some Birds to make her light, and by all means she must be adorned with some chains of Sausages, &c. This dish is much in request with us, and is commonly pronounced Ollia; the second l in Spanish being melted in the pronunciation like an i. It hath some Analogy with that the French call a Bisque.
