Castor and Pa cent llux, the sons of Jupiter and Leda, whom he lay with in the shape of a Swan, they being grown to age, freed the sea of Pirates, and were therefore counted gods of the sea; they went with Jason to Colchos, and coming home, they recovered their sister from Theseus, and won the Town Aphydna, wherein Castor died, Pollux, who was born in the same Egge with Helena, and so became immortal, desired of Jupiter that his brother might partake of immortality with him, whereupon they were both reported to live and die by turns.
