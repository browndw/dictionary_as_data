Caspian Sea (mare Caspium) a Sea near Hyrcania, that hath no passage into any other Sea, but is a huge Lake, and neither ebbs nor flows. Therefore Sir Philip Sidney (to note, that he persisted always one) depainted out this Sea surrounded with his Shoars, and over it this Motto, Sine refluxu, for his Devise.
