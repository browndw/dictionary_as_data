Knights of the Shire, two Knights, or other Gentlemen of worth, that are chosen by the freeholders of every County, that can dispend fourty shillings per annum, and be resident in the Shire; formerly none but Knights were chosen to that Office (Milites gladio cincti, for so runneth the Tenour of the Writ) when every one that had a Knights fee was constrained to be a Knight, but now custome alloweth that Esquires may be chosen, so that they be resident in the County.
