Scavage, otherwise called Shewage, is a kinde of Toll or Custom exacted, by Majors, and Bayliffs of Cities and Burrough Towns, of Merchants for Wares shewed to be sold within their Precinct, which is forbidden by the Statute of 19 H. 7.8. It comes of the Saxon word (Sceaw) to behold or view, or to shew; and hence the word Sceaw-stow, a Theatre or Shew-place, a beholding place. Verstegan.
