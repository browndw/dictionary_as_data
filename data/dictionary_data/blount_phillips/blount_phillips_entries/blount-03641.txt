Epitaph (epitaphium) an Inscription or writing, set upon a Tomb, most commonly in lamentation or praise of the party there buried: The invention whereof is referred to the Scholars of Linus, who first bewailed their Master, when he was slain, in doleful verses, then called of him Aelina, afterwards Epitaphia, for that they were first sung at burials, after engraved upon the Sepulchers. According to Plato's Laws an Epitaph should be comprised in four Verses. The Lacedemonians reserved this honor only to Martial men, and chaste women. Cam.
