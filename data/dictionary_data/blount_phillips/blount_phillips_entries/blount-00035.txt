Abjuration (abjuratio) a forswearing or renouncing by Oath. In our Common Law it is an Oath taken to forsake the Realm for ever. But there is a latter Oath so called; which concerns matters of belief, and was confirmed and established by Ordinance, 1643. ca. 15. and enlarged 1656. ca. 16. which may be tendred to any person, suspected of Popish Recusancy, at the age of 16. and is impugned by a notable Treatise called the Christian Moderator, Part 3.
