Incubus, (lat.) a certain disease called the night-mare, which is caused by the ascending of raw humours up into the brain, and obstructing the animal spirits; it oppresseth people in their sleep, and causeth them to imagin that some great weight is lying upon them. There is also mention made in some Stories of certain spirits, that having taken upon them humane shapes, have mixed in carnal copulation with mortal persons, the male spirit is called Incubus, the female Succubus.
