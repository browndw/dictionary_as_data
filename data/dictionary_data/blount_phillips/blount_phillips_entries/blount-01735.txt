Centaurs (Centauri) people of Thessaly, who first devised to break horses for war, whence they being seen by other people on horseback, were supposed to be but one creature, which had the upper part of his body like a man, and the nether part like a horse. This was in the time of the war between the Thessalians and the Lapithae, Ann. Mundi 2724. Rider. Or (as Servius declares) when some yong Thessalians on hors-back were beheld afar off, while their horses watered, that is, while their heads were depressed, they were conceived by their first spectators, to be but one animal, and answerable hereunto have their pictures been drawn ever since.
