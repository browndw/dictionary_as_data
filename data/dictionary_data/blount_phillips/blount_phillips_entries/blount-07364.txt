Oxgang of Land (Bovala terrae) six Ox-gangs of land seem to be so much as six Oxen will plough. Cromp. Iurisd. fol. 220. But an Ox-gang seems properly to be spoken of such as lies in Gainour. Old nat. br. fol. fol. 117. Mr. Skene de verbor. signif. verbo (bovata terrae) saith an Ox-gang of land should always contain thirteen Acres, and that four Oxen-gates extended to a pound land of old extent.
