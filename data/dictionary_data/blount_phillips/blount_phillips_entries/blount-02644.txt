The Cycle of the Moon is the revolution of 19 years, in which space (though not precisely) the Lunations recur. For, because of the Sun and Moons unequal motions, the changes fallia cent g out inconstantly, the time of conjunction could not be still the same. This variety the Antients perceiving to be periodical, endeavoured to comprehend what Circle it made in going about. The learned Metoa cent , finding the Revolution was not compleated in less time then the space of 19 years, set forth his Ennedecaetris, within the Circle whereof the Lunations (though not exactly) do indeed recur, so that if the quadrature of the Moon shall fall out as this day of this year, the like shall return again, the same day of the 19 year succeeding. This Cycle is therefore called Cyclus decennovennalis, and from the Author Annus Metonicus; from whose Athenians the Egyptians may seem to have received it, as the Romans from them, in Letters of gold; from whence (if not from the more precious use of it) it obtained to be called, as it still is, the numerus aureus, or Golden number. It was made Christian by the Fathers of the Nicene-Council, as being altogether necessary to the finding out the Neomenia Paschalis, upon which the Feast of Easter, and all the moveable rest depended. It self is found by adding an unite to the year of our Lord, and dividing the whole by 19. the remainder shall be the Cycle of the Moon; or if nothing remain, the Cycle is out, that is nineteen.
