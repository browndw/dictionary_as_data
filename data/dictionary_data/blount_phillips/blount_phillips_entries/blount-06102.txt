Locust (locusta) a kind of flying insect, or Fly (which the French term Cigale) of which we have none in England. See Dr. Brown in his Vul. Err. lib. 5. ca. 3. There were divers kinds of these; some hurtful and venemous, others comodious for meat, Mat. 3.4. His meat was locusts, which some conceive to be the tops of herbs and plants.
