Pale Matlle (Fr.) a game wherein a round bowle is with a Mallet struck through a high arch or iron (standing at either end of an Alley) which he that can do at the fewest blows, or at the number agreed on, wins. This Game was heretofore used at the Alley near St. Jameses, and vulgarly called Pel-Mell.
