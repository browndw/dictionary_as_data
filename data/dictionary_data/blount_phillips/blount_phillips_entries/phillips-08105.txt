Myrtilus, the son of Mercury and Phaethusa, he was the Chariot-driver of Oenomaus, who being to run a race with Pelops Myrtilus being promised a great reward, loosened the axeltree so, that the Chariot being overturned Oenomaus fell out and broke his neck, but before he died, he intreated Pelops to revenge his death; whereupon when Myrtilus came to demand his reward, he was thrown into that Sea which from thence was called Mare Myrtoum, now Mar de Mandria.
