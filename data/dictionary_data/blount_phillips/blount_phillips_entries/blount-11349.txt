AEnity of possession, in our Law, is a joynt possession of two Rights by several Titles. For example, I take a Lease of Land from one upon a certain Reut; afterwards I buy the Fee simple; this is an AEnity of possession, whereby the Lease is extinguished, by reason, I, who had before the occupation only for my rent, am become Lord of the same, and am to pay my rent to none but my self.
