Narcissus, a youth of great beauty, the son of Cephisus and Liriope, of whom the Prophet Tyresias foretold that he should live so long as he should abstain from beholding himself; he being beloved of many Nimphs and especially of Echo, was insensible to all their loves, & at length coming to drink of a clear Fountain, and beholding his image in the water, he fell in love with it, and seeing no hopes of injoying it, he pined away for grief and was changed into a Flower of the same name, vulgarly called a white Daffadilly, and Echo seeing her self despised likewise, pined away, and was changed into a voice. Also the name of a Bishop of Jerusalem, who when oil was wanting at Divine service for the Lamps, by his prayers turned water into oil.
