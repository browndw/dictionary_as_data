Croesus, a King of the Lydians, who abounded in riches; he was overcome in war by Cyrus, and put upon a pile to be burnt, and calling out Solon, Solon, Cyrus demanding the reason, he acquainted him how that Solon having formerly been asked of him who was the happiest man, told him none could be happy till his death, and that the greatest riches could not keep a man from misery; whereupon he was freed and made one of Cyrus his Counsellers.
