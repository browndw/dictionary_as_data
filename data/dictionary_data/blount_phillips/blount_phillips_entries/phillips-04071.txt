Easter, the time of the celebration of Christs Resurrection, contracted from the Dutch word Aufferstand, i. e. Resurrection, or from Eoster, an ancient Goddesse of the Saxons, whose Feast they kept about the same time, namely, about April, which was thence called Eoster-monath. It is also called Pasca, from the Hebrew, word Pasach, to passe over, because about this time, the Jews celebrated the Feast of the Passeover.
