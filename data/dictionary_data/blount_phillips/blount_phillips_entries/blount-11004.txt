Adipal or Adiposous veins (venae adiposae) are two veins, a right (sometimes a branch of the right kidney-vein) and a left one (ever a branch of the descendant trunk of the hollow vein) which particularly nourish the fat and skin that's about the kidney, and generally breed fat in those parts by which they run.
