Opera (Lat.) a work, labor; diligence, study, &c. In Italy it signifies a Tragedy, Tragi-Comedy, Comedy or Pastoral, which (being the studied work of a Poet) is not acted after the vulgar manner, but performed by Voyces in that way, which the Italians term Recitative, being likewise adorned with Scenes by Perspective, and extraordinary advantages by Musick. The common Plays (which are not Opera's) are performed ex tempore by the Actors, and are but in the nature of Farces, wanting the above-mentioned adornments.
