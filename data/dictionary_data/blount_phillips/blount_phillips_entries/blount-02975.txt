Dialect (dialectus) is a manner of speech peculiar to some part of a Country or people, and differing from the manner used by other parts or people, yet all using the same Radical Language, for the main or substance of it. In England, the Dialect in the North, is different from that in the South; and the Western differs from both. As in this example; At London we say, I would eat more cheese if I had it, the Northern man saith, Ay sud eat mare cheese gin ay hader, and the Western man saith, Chudee' at more cheese un ich had it, or on chad it.
