Greek Church differs from the Roman Catholick. 1. Denying the Holy Ghost to proceed from the Father and the Son. 2. Denying Purgatory, but praying for the dead. 3. Beleeving that holy men enjoy not the presence of God before the Resurrection. 4. Communicating in both kinds; but using leavened bread, and mingling warm water with wine, which both together they destribute with a spoon. 5. Receiving children of seven years old to the Sacrament, because then they begin to sin. 6. Forbidding extream Unction, Confirmation, and fourth Marriages. 7. Admitting none to Orders, but such as are married, and prohibiting marriage to them that are actually in Orders. 8. Rejecting carved Images, but admitting the painted. 9. Observing four Lents in the year. 10. Reputing it unlawful to fast on Saturdays. So Heylin. But others relate the differences to be otherwise, as may be seen in Authors that write thereof.
