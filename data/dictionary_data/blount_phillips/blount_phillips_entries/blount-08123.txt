Pourpresture (from the Fr. Pourpris, i. a close or enclosure) is thus defined in Glanvile; lib. 9. cap. 11. Pourprestura est propriA, quando aliquid super Dominum Regem injustA occupatur, &c. Cromp. in his Jurisd. fol. 152. defines it thus. Pourpresture is properly when a man takes to himself or incroaches any thing that he ought not, whether it be in any jurisdiction, Land, or Franchise, and generally when any thing is done to the Nusance of the Kings Tenant, &c.
