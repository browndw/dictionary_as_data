Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon, and Clytemnestra, she was adjudged to be sacrificed to Diana, because that goddesse being incensed against Agamemnon for killing one of her harts, kept the Navy of the Greeks by contrary windes from their intended course, but after that Vlisses had by craft obtained her of her mother, and all things in a readinesse for the sacrifice, Diana accepted of a Hart, so that Iphigenia was set free and sent to Taurica, where she was made Over-seer of the rites of that goddesse, (which were performed by the sacrificing of men) by Thoas the King of that place, who was afterwards slain by Orestes, who was designed to be offered for a sacrifice.
