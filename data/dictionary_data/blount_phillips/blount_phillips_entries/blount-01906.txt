There is also a kind of writing, which we call by Ciphers or Characters, whereof every exercised Statesman hath peculiar to himself, and which was invented by J. Caesar, when he first began to think of the Roman Monarchy, and was by him in his Letters to his more private and retired friends, used, that if by misfortune they should be intercepted, the contents of them should not be understood; ne obvia literarum lectio cuivis esset. Heyl.
