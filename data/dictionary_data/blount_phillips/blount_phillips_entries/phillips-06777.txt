Julian, sirnamed the Apostate, because that being brought up in the Christian religion, he fell back to Heathenisme: he was the son of Constantius, and by his valour came to be made Roman Emperour, he prohibited to the Christians all kind of learning, that through their ignorance, they might become uncapable to defend their religion: at last, in an expedition against the Persians, being mortally wounded, he cryed out, vicisti Galilaee, Thou hast overcome, O Galilaean, meaning Christ; and soon after dyed: also, a proper name of women, contracted Juliana, some write it Gilian.
