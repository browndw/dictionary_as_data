Orfraies (aurifrisium) frizled cloth of gold, made and used in England both before and since the Conquest, worn both by the Clergy and the Kings themselves, as may appear out of Math. Paris, where he speaks of the Ornaments sent by the Abbots of England to the Pope; and also by a Record in the Tower, where the King commands the Templars to deliver such Jewels, Garments, and Ornaments, as they had of his in keeping; among which he names Dalmaticum velatum de Orefreis, that is a damask garment guarded with Orfraies. Of old the Jackets or Coat Armors of the Kings Guard, were also termed Orfrais, because they were covered with Goldsmiths work.
