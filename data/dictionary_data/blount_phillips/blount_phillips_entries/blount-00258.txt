Agist (from the Fr. gist) signifies in our Common Law to take in and feed the Cattle of strangers in the Kings Forest, and to gather the money due for the same to the Kings use: the Officers that do this are called Agistors, or Guest-takers, of whom the King had four in every Forest, where he had any Pawnage; their function is termed Agistment, which is also used for the taking in of cattle into the Parks or grounds of Subjects. Hence comes the word gisting, or (as the Country people corrupt it) joysting of cattle. Manwood For. Laws. See Pawnage.
