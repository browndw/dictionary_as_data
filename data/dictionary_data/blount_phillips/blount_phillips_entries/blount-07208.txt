Olympick Games (olympia) Games instituted by Hercules in honor of Jupiter; they were celebrated every fifth year in the Plains of Elis, a City of Peloponnesus, and the Exercises were five; Running, Wrestling, Leaping, Quoiting, and Whorle-bats. The reward to those that overcame in these feats of activity was nothing but a Garland of Olive branches, lest covetousness, rather then vertue, should make them strive for victory. They took name from the City Olympia, otherwise Pisa. Sir Wat. Ral. lib. 2. fol. 490.
