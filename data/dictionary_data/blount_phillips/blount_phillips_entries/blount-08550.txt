Purgatory (purgatorium) a purgation or state of purging. The Council of Trent, Sect. 15. defines, that there is a Purgatory, and that the souls detained there are benefitted by the prayers of the faithful. And the Roman Catholiques hold, that the souls of Christians, not dying in a perfect estate, remain in a condition which may be eased and meliorated by the Prayers, Oblations and Charity of the living; and they cite St. Augustine for it, de verbo Apost. Ser. 32.
