Shrewsbury, the chief Town of Shropshire, anciently called Schroesbury, for that it was a Thicket of shrubs upon a Hill; it is called in the Brittish tongue Ymwithig from Mewithaw, which is as much as Placentia or Plaisance, in regard that for the pleasantnesse of the situation, the Princes of Wales chose it in times past for their chief Seat. Here Edrick Streona Duke of the Mercians lay in wait for Prince Afhelm, and slew him as he rode on hunting. This Town is also commonly called Salop, and in Latin Salopia.
