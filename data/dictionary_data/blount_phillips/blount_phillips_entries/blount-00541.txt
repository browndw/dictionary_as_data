Annats, First fruits paid of spiritual things; so called because the rate so paid, is also after one years profit. These Annats (says Pol. Virg.) began first at the Popes own Benefices, whereof he was Patron. But Clement the fifth generally decreed it in the year 1305. Boniface the ninth, and John the 22th renewed that Decree.
