Manchester, a pleasant Town in Lancashire, which anciently belonging to the Kings of Northumberland, and having been destroyed in the Danish war, King Edw. the Elder, sent an Army of Mercians into Northumberland, to re-edifie this Citie; some say, because the inhabitants behaved themselves valiantly against the Danes, it was called Manchester, as it were the Citie of men, others derive it from Main, i. a stone, because it standeth upon a stony Hill; it was anciently called Mancunium.
