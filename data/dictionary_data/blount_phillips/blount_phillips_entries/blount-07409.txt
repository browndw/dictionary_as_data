Pall (pallium) a Mantle, such as the Knights of the Garter wear; a long Garment or Robe which Philosophers wore. But it is most used for a Pontifical Vesture made of Lambs Wooll, in breadth not exceeding three fingers, and having two Labels hanging down before and behinde, which the Pope gives or sends to Archbishops and Metropolitans, and they at the Altar, wear it about their necks, above their other Ornaments. The Pall was first given to the Bishop of Ostia, by P. Marcus the second, An. 336. Also the velvet laid over a dead body is called the Pall.
