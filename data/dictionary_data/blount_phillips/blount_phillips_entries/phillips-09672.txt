Pruneth, a Term in Faulconry, they say a Hawk Pruneth, and not picketh her self; yet a Hawk cannot be said properly to prune her self, but when she beginneth at her legs, and fetcheth moisture at her tail, wherewith she embalmeth her feet, and striketh the feathers of her wings through her beak, and this fetching off the Oyl is called the Note.
