Magog (mentioned in Ezek. 38.) Gog in the Hebrew signifies (saith St. Hierom) tectum, or a covering of a house. And Pintus, upon Ezekiel affirms, that by Gog is meant Antichrist; For (saith he) Antichristus erit Diaboli tegumentum sub specie humana; That Antichrist shall be the covering of the Devil under humane form. He adds that Magog, is as much to say as Gog, the letter [M] being an Hebrew Preposition and imports as much as of or from, so he takes Magog for those people that follow Antichrist. See more in exposition of these two words in Sir Walt. Ral. hist. lib. 1. fol. 136.
