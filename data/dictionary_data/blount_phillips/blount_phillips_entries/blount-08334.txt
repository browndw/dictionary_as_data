Probate of Testaments, (probatio Testamentorum) proving of Wills, is the producting and insinuating of dead mens Wills before the Judges appointed for that purpose by Act 1653. cap. 2. and 1656. cap. 10. This Probate is made in two sorts, either in common form (which is onely by the Executors oath) or by witnesses.
