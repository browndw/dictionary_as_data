Euripe (Euripus) signifies generally any Strait, Fret, or Channel of the Sea, running between two shoars, as Julius Pollux defines it. But Euripus Euboicus or Chalcidicus, is a narrow passage of Sea dividing Attica and the Island of Euboea now called Golpho de Negroponte, which ebbs and flows seven times every day: the reason of which when Aristotle could not find, it is said he threw himself into the Sea with these words, Quia ego non capio te, tu capias me. But see Dr. Br. Vul. Er. fol. 364. Hence.
