Magician, (lat.) one that professeth the Art Magick, which was the same among the Persians, as Philosophy among the Grecians, i. e. the study of the more occult and mysterious Arts; whence the 3 Wisemen of the East were called Magi, but among the vulgar, the word simply taken, is used in the same signification as Diabolical Magick, i. e. Sorcery or Witchcraft.
