A step is two foot and an half, the fadom seven foot, an English Ell three foot, and nine inches; which measures differ from other Countries that have a Geometrical measure; as four baley corns in thickness make a Finger or measure, four Fingers a Hand, four of those Hands in breadth a Foot, five of those Feet a Geometrical Pace, and 125 Paces a Furlong; eight Furlongs, or 1000 Paces, five foot to a Pace, make an Italian mile; 3000 Paces make a league, 4000 a common Dutch mile, and 5000 Paces make a German or great Dutch mile.
