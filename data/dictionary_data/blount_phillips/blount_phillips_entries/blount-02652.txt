Cymbal (cymbalum) was a kind of instrument, composed of thin plates of brass, with certain small bars of Iron, fastned and cross billeted in the plates, wherewith they made a great noise. Others think Cymbals are bells, which, according to the opinion of some, were consecrated to the service of the Church by Pope Sabinian. Caussin.
