Hercules Pillars, On the North side of the Straight called of old Fretum Herculeum, was Mount Calpe, on the South, Mount Abila, on which Hercules placed his so memorized Pillars, with the Inscription Nil AEltra, because that was then conceived to be the most Western bound of the world. But Charls the fifth, after the discovery of America, coming that way caused Plus AEltra to be engraven, either on the old Pillars, or else on new erected in their places. Hercules is said to have faln into the Falling-sickness, by over much eating Quails, which disease has ever since been termed Hercules sickness. Dr. Muffet.
