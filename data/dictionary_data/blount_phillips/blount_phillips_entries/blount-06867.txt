Natal or Natalitious gifts (munera natalitia) among the Grecians, the Midwives, the fifth day after the childes birth, ran about a fire made for the same purpose; using that ceremony, as a purification of themselves & the child; on this day the neighbors also sent in gifts or small tokens; from which custom, that among Christians of the Godfathers sending gifts to the baptized Infant, is thought to have flown; and that also of the neighbors sending gifts to the mother of it, as is still used in Northwales.
