Marque (seems to a French word, signifying notam, vel signum, or else to come from the Germ. March, i. limes, or from Marc, a Britan word (used not onely by the now Welch, but also by the Armoricans) signifying as much as note or character) signifies in the antient Statutes of our Land, as much as Reprisals; as A. 4. H. 5. c. 7. Marques and Reprizals are used as Synonima; and letters of Marque are found in the same signification in the same Chapter. See Law of Marque
