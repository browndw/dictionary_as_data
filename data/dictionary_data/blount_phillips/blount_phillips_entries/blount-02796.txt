Degrade (degrado) to put out of Office, to put from his degree, estate, or dignity. In Sleidans Comment. you may read the manner of degrading Priests to be thus. The party to be degraded is attired in his Priestly Vestments, and holds in the one hand a Chalice filled with wine mixed with water, and in the other a gilt patent with a Wafer or bread. Then kneeling down the Bishops Deputy first takes from him all these things, commanding him to say no more Masses. Secondly, scraping his fingers end with a piece of glass, he enjoyns him never to hallow any thing. And thirdly, stripping him of his Priestly Vestments, he is clothed in a Lay habit, and so delivered into the power of the Secular Magistrate, if his offence so require it.
