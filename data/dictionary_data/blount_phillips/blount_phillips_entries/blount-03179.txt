Natural Divination, may be divided into two branches, whereof the first is that which hath in former times been practised by wicked spirits in Oracles and Answers given by them in Idols, and is at this day sometimes seen in possessed persons, who by suggestion of the Devil may foretel things to come, and this is but a Natural Divination: For though to us it seem miraculous, because of our ignorance in the causes and courses of things, yet in those spirits it is but natural, who by their long experience and great observation, besides the knowledge of secrets in Nature, and their quick intelligence from all places, are able to fore-see much more, then we by nature can.
