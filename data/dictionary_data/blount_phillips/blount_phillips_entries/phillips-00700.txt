Anglesey, an Island lying over against Caernarvon in Wales, it was anciently the seat of the Druides, and was called by the Brittains, Ynis Dowil, and the land of Mon, in Latin Mona. It was first attempted by Paulinus Swetonius, and afterwards brought under the Roman Empire by Julius Agricola, many ages after it was Conquered by the English-men, and thence derived this name as it were the English-mens Island.
