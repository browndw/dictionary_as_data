Graces (Charites) three Sisters Poetically supposed the Daughters of Jupiter and Venus: They were called Aglaia, Thalia, and Euphrosyne: The moral was, to express the mutual love, and chearful conversation, which ought to be among friends; for they were painted naked, to signifie friendship ought to be plain without dissimulation; smiling and merry, to shew men should do good willingly; young, and maiden-like, to teach, friendship should consist in honest things; and holding hands together in a round ring, to shew a benefit bestowed, returns again to the giver.
