These Indictions (as Bede notes) began the 24 day of September, and were devised (as he thinks) to avoid confusion in Chronology. Indiction is most properly said de Tributo indicto, as appears by the title in the Code (lib. 10. Tit. 16.) And these Indictions began at the very dismission of the Nicen Council; succeeding (saith Onuphrius) in place of the Olympiads, which as unchristian, the Emperor had forbidden. Greg. See Epoche.
