Reprisal (Fr. ReprisaillA(C)) a taking, a resting, or seising on, for a distress or pledge; also a Prize. Reprisals are all one in the Common and Civil Law; Est potestas pignorandi contra quemlibet de terra debitoris data creditori pro injuriis & damnis acceptis. This among the antient Romans was called Clarigation (from clarigo, i. res clare repeto.) It is called in the last Statute of 27 Ed. 3. cap. 17. Law of Marque. And the reason may be, because one destitute of Justice in another Territory, redresses himself by the Goods belonging to persons of that Territory, taken within his own bounds; see Law of Marque; and see Acts 1649.38. and 1650.7.
