Gnosticks, a Sect of Hereticks (their first, according to the more common opinion, was Carpocras) sprung about the year of Christ 125. in time of Pope Xistus the first, and the Emperor Adrian the first; they arrogated to themselves a high degree of skill and knowledge in all things, and therefore were called Gnostici, from the Gr. a in non-Latin alphabet a, cognitio; they were also called Borboritae or Borboriani for abominable foul practises they had among them: They held the soul of man to be of Gods substance; they held two Gods, one good, the other bad; they denied the future judgement, so to gain more liberty to their vices, and progress to their Doctrine, with other absurd errors.
