Tunnocellum, the ancient name of a Town in Northumberland, by Camden thought to be the same with that which we now call Tinmouth, q the mouth of the River Tine, where the first Cohort Aelia Classica was in pay for Sea-service. This Town hath a very strong Castle, which Robert Mowbray Earle of Northumberland holding against King William Rufus, was therein closely besieged and taken prisoner.
