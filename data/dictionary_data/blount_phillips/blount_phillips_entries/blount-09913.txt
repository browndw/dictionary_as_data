Stews, are those places, where women of professed incontinency, proffer their bodies to all commers; from the Fr. Estuve, i. a Bathe or Hot-house; because wantons are wont to prepare or rather to purge themselves for those venereous acts by often bathing and Hot-houses. And that this is not new, Homer shews in the eighth Book of his Odiss. where he reckons hot Bathes among the effeminate sort of pleasures. Of these Stewes see the Statute, An. 11. H. 6. ca. 1.
