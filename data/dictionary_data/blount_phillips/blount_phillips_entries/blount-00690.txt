Appellative (appellativus) naming, mentioning or calling. Grammatically it is taken for common, opposite to proper; as this word homo, a man, is by the Grammarians called a Noun, or name appellative, because common to all men; and this word Petrus, Peter, is a Noun or name proper to one individual person.
