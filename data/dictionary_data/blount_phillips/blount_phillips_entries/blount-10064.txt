Succentor (Lat.) he that singeth the Base. See Incentor. Our phrase, an old Sincantor, is either a corruption from this word; or if it be written with a C, then tis from the Fr. Cinquante, which signifies fifty, and so may be taken for one that is fifty years of age or above. Act of Parl. 1649. ca. 24. mentions Succenter as one of those Officers abolished with Deans and Chapters.
