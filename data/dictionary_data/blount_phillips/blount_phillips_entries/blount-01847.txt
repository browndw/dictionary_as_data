Chiromancy (chiromantia) Palmestry, a kind of divination practised by looking on the lines or marks of the fingers and hands; an Art still in use, among Fortune-tellers, Egyptians and Juglers. And is (according to my Lord Bacon) a meer Imposture. Chiromancy according to Paracelsus, treats not of the lineaments of the hands only, but also of the whole body, and not only of men, but of all natural things. Of which read Dr. Rothmans Treatise translated into English by Mr. Wharton. 1652.
