Ballista (Lat.) an ancient warlike Engin to cast or shoot darts or stones, to batter and shake City walls, made with ropes of sinews and womens hair twined together: As appears by Venus Calva at Rome, to whom, by reason the women of the City parted with their hair for that purpose, a Temple was dedicated. The form of this Engin you may read in Godwin's Anthology, lib. 4. cap. 3.
