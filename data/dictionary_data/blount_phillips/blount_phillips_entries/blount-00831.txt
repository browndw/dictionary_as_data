Arrianism, An antient and pestilent Heresie (hatched by one Arrius a Lybian born (but a Priest of Alexandria) who denied the Son to be consubstantial or of the same substance with God the Father, and asserted him a Creature made by God, capable of vice, &c. To beat down which Heresie, the first Council of Nice was called, the Nicen Creed made, and the Clause of one substance with the Father, proved to be consentaneous to the word. To subscribe the Decrees of this Council, Arrius was sent for by the Emperor Constantine; To whom he went, having written his own heretical Tenets, which he hid in his bosom, and reading before the Emperor the Decrees of the Council, he wrote a Recantation of his heresie, swearing that he meant as he had written; which words the Emperor referred to the Recantation, but he to the paper of his own Tenets in his bosom: when he had taken this Oath, he went in triumph through the streets of the City, till a necessity of nature enforcing him, he withdrew aside to a house of ease, where he voided out his guts, and sent his Soul as a Harbinger to the Devil, to provide room for his body.
