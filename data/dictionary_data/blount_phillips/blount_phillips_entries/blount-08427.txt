Proposition (propositio) that whereby we shew what we will speak or prove, a sentence or matter propounded, a Question or Position. In Logick the first part of a Syllogism is called the Proposition or Major; and this hath three parts, Subjectum, Praedicatum, and Copula; as Peter is a man; Peter is the Subject, Man is the Predicate or Attribute, and the Verb [is] is the Copula, or tying them together.
