Patroclus, the son of Menoetius and Sthenele, he having slain Cleonymus the son of Amphidamas, fled to Phia, where he was intertained by Peleus, and together with Achilles educated by the Centaure Chiron, afterwards he went to the wars of Troy with Achilles, with whom he had contracted an inviolable friendship, and when Achilles having made a defection from the Grecian Army could by no means be won to fight with Hector, he at last was prevailed with to send Patroclus in his stead, and with his own armour, in which fight Patroclus being slain, Achilles then whom no other respect could move, would fight to revenge the death of his friend, and having new arms made for him by Vulcan, he fought with Hector and slew him.
