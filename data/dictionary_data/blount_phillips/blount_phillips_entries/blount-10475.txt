Testament, testamentum, i. testatio mentis, the witness of of the minde, as the last Will & Testament is, of which there are two sorts, viz. nuncupatory, and in writing; The first is when a man being sick, and for fear least death, want of memory or speech should come so suddenly upon him, that he should be prevented, if he staid the writing his Will, desires his neighbours and friends to bear witness of his last Will, and then declares the same by words before them; which after his decease, being proved by the witnesses, and put in writing by the Ordinary, stands in as good force (except for lands) as if it had in his life time been put in writing, &c. Some distinguish Testaments from Wills, as if the first concerned lands onely, and the other personal estate. Of this read the Duty of Executors.
