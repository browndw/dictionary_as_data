Sycamore (Sycamorus) a Tree like a Fig-tree, having great branches, and large leaves like a Mulberry; it bears fruit three or four times in a year, much like a wilde Fig, but without any Seeds within. The fruit grows upon the very body of the Tree and the great main boughs, and will never be ripe, except it be scraped with an iron tool. It is found plentifully in Caria, Egypt, and the Isle of Rhodes, especially in such places were Wheat will not grow.
