Adultery (adulterium) properly spoken of married persons; but if onely one of two persons, by whom this sin is committed, be married, it makes Adultery; and this is felony by Act of Parl. 1650. ca. 10. Adulterium, seems to have taken that name, as it were ad alterius thorum, i. to anothers bed, which the Adulterer always aims at.
