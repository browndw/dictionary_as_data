Pontificalibus (the Ablative case plural of Pontificalis) a Bishop is said to be in his Pontificalibus, when he is vested in his Episcopal Ornaments, to say or sing Divine service, upon some Festival day. We commonly say such a one is in his Pontificalibus, when he is in rich attire, or his best apparel.
