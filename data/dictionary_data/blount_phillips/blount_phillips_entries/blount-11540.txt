Zone (zona) a Girdle; In Cosmography it signifies a division made of the Heavens into five parts, whereof one is extream hot, two extream cold, and two temperate. The hot or torrid Zone, is all that part of the Heavens, which is contained between the two Tropicks of Cancer and Capricorn, in which Zone the Sun continually keeps his course. The two cold or frigid Zones are scituate between the two Polar Circles, and the very Poles, continually wanting the neighbourhood of the Sun: The two temperate are betwixt the Tropicks of Cancer and the Artick, and betwixt the Tropick of Capricorn, and the Antartick Circles, enjoying an indifferency between heat and cold; So that the parts next the torrid Zone are the hotter, and those next the frigid are the colder. These five Zones are disposed according to the order of the five Zones in Heaven.
