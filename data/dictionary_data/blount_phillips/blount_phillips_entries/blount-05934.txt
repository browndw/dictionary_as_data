League (Ital. and Span. legua, Lat. leuca, from the Gr. leucos, i. white, because they did in old time, pitch white stones at every leagues end from the City.) The difference of miles in several Countries is great, but it will be enough to know, that the Italian and English are reckoned all for one (though some hold the Italian to be the lesser) and four of these make a German mile, two a French league, three and somewhat more a Spanish league; the Swedish or Danish mile consists of five English miles, and somewhat more; a league at Sea is usually held to be three English miles.
