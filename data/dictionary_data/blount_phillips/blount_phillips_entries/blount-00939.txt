Assize (from the Norman word Assize, and that derived from the Fr. asseoire, i. collocare) is a word diversly used in our Common Law. Littleton, in the Chapter of Rents, saith it is aequivocal, and sets down three significations of it; one as it is taken for a Writ; another as it is used for a Jury; the third as for an Ordinance.
