Comet (cometa) a blazing star. It is properly a great quantity of exhalations hot and dry, fat and clammy, hard, compact like a great lump of pitch, which, by the heat and attractive vertue of the Sun and Stars, is drawn up from the earth into the highest Region of the Air, where, being near the Element of fire, it is enflamed, and appears like a Star with a blazing tail, and sometime is moved after the motion of the Air, which is circular, but it never goes down out of the Compass of sight (though it be not seen in the day time for the brightness of the Sun) but still burns till all the matter be consumed. Goodly Gallery.
