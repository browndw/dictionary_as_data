Brackmans, a Sect of Philosophers in India, that lived onely by hearbs, roots, and fruit. These Brackmans or Bramines are now the Indian Priests (perhaps following the custom of the Egyptians who were wont to chuse their Priests out of their whole number of Philosophers) and are of like authority in their Church, as the Mufties are among the Turks, and as the Flamines and Arch-flamines were among the heathen Romans, or as the Druids among the Britains and Gauls. They hate Mahumed, and acknowledge one God and Creator of all things: the better sort are called Mockadams, or Masters. Herb. Tr.
