So a second Letter written and sent to the same purpose, as the former, and to the same party for fear of miscarriage of the first, or for other reason, is called a Duplicat: and when such a second letter is written, to be sent, the custom is to write the word Duplicat in the head of the Letter, to signifie that it is a second Letter. A third Letter may also after the same manner be called a Triplicate.
