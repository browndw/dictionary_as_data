Blackmore Forrest, a Forrest in Dorcetshire, called also the Forrest of Whitehart from a very beautifull Whitehart, which King Henry the third, going thither a hunting, and taking great care to spare, was killed by T. de la Linde, which so incensed the King, that he set a perpetual Fine upon the Land, which at this day is called Whitehart silver.
