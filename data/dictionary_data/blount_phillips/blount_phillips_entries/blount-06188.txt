Lutheranism, the doctrine or Tenets of Martin Luther, who (being an Augustin Monk) forsook his Monastical course of life, about the year 1515, and from him Lutherans took denomination: These differ from the Calvinists, chiefly in maintaining consubstantiation in the blessed Eucharist, with omnipresence, and eternal predestination, to be out of a foreseen faith, and good works, and not absolute; which tenents are impugned by the Calvinists.
