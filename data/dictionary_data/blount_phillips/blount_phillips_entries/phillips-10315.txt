Salmacis, a Fountain of Caria, near Halicarnassus; so called from Salmacis, a Nymph, who falling in love with Hermaphroditus, the son of Mercury and Venus, when she could by no other means draw him to her love, she leapt into the Fountain, and imbracing him, prayed unto the gods that they might grow into one, whereupon they immediately became one person, having both Sexes; also at the prayers of Hermaphroditus the Fountain contracted this quality, that who ever entred into it, were transformed into both Sexes, and called Hermaphrodites.
