Cimmerians, a northern people whose Country by reason of its distance from the Sun, is alwayes dark: whence Cimmerian darknesse is taken for a very thick obscurity. They live near a certain narrow sea, which from them is called Bospha cent rus Cia cent imerius. There is also a people of Italy, so called, living between Baiae and Cumae, incompassed about with high hills.
