Baile (from the Fr. Bailler. i. attribuere, tradere, tribuere) is used in our Common Law properly for the freeing or setting at liberty one arrested or imprisoned upon action either civil or criminal, under surety taken for his appearance at a day and place certainly assigned. Bract. lib. 3. cap. 8. num. 8. & 9.
