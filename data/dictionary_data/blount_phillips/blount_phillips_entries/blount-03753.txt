Estovers (from the French estovA(C)r, i. to foster) signifies in our Common Law nourishment or maintenance. For example, Bracton l. 3. tract. 2. cap. 18. num. 2. useth it for that sustenance which a man, taken for Felony, is to have out of his lands or goods, for himself and his family, during his imprisonment: and the Stat. An. 6. E. 1. cap. 3. useth it for an allowance in meat or cloth. It is also used for certain allowances of wood, to be taken out of another mans wood. Mr. West part. 2. Symbol. tit. Fines sect 26. saith, that the name of Estovers contains house-boot, hey-boot and plow-boot, as if he gave in his grant these general words, de ratia cent nabili estoveria in boscis, &c. he may thereby claim these three.
