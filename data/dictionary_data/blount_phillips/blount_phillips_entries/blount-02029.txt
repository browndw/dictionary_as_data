Cocka cent ey or Cockneigh applyed onely to one born within the sound of Bow-bell, that is within the City of London, which term came first (according to Minshew) out of this Tale; A Citizens Son riding with his Father out of London into the Country, and being utterly ignorant how corn grew, or Cattel increased, asked, when he heard a horse neigh, what he did? his Father answered, the horse doth neigh: riding farther, the Son heard a Cock crow, and said, doth the Cock neigh too? Hence by way of jeer he was called Cock-neigh.
