Charls (in the antient Teutonick, from whence this name takes original) was first Garedel, whereof by abbreviation it became Careal, now in the modern Teutonick it is Barle. Gar did signifie all, and edel or ethel, noble; so that Charles signifies all or wholly noble. In the old Saxon it was Ceorl. Verst.
