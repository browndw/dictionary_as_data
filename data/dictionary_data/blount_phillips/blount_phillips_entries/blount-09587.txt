Shibboleth or Schibboleth (Hebr. i. spica) by the pronounciation of this word, the Galaadites (who fought for, and under Jepthe, the Judge of Israel) discovered the Ephramites to be their enemies, and not Galaadites, as they pretended to be for their safety; for when they were taken by the true Galaadites at the passages over Jordan (through which they endeavored to escape) they ceuld not pronounce Shibboleth or Schibboleth, but Sibboleth which cost two and forty thousand of them their lives at that time, Judges cap. 12. Hence the word is usually taken for a word of trial, to discern Citizens from Aliens; Friends from Foes. See Pichigni.
