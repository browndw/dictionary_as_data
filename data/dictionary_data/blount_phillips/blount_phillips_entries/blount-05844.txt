Howbeit Div. Chrysostome saith, there are certain living creatures, or wilde beasts inhabiting the utmost and desert places of Africk, which from the face to the navel, were excellently beautiful, and their fashion was to lay open their Alabaster necks and breasts to the view of men, that so they might allure and draw them near, and then devoure them. And to this purpose the Prophet Jeremy saith, The Lamiae have discovered and drawn forth their brests, and shewn their dugs, Lam. 4. The Hebrew Doctors interpret them Devils of the Desert, in expounding that word of Isay, Tsijim (Isa. 13,) that it should signifie Lamioe. Tr. of Specters.
