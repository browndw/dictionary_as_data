Lya cent aon, the son of Pelasgus, and King of Arcadia, who when Jupiter came into Arcadia in the likenesse of a mortal man, resolved to try whether he were a God, or no, as men reported him to be, and killing one of those, whom the King of the Molossi had left with him for pledges, he caused him to be dressed, and part rosted, to be set before Jupiter, whereat he being highly provoked turned Lycaon into a Wolf, and burnt his Pallace with Thunder, others say it was for sprinkling with the bloud of an Infant, an Altar which he had erected to Jupiter upon the Mountain Lycaeus, a hill of Arcadia.
