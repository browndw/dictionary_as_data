Salisbury, the chief Citie of Wiltshire, risen up out of the ruines of a very ancient Town called Sorbiodunum, and by vulgar Latinists Sarum, and Sarisburia, this place is famous for a stately Minster, built here in the reign of King Henry the third, by Richard Poor, then Bishop of Salisbury; this Cathedral hath as many windows as there are dayes in the year, as many pillars as there are hours in a year, and the gates are answerable in number to the 12 moneths.
