Alleluiah or Alleluia (Heb.) Praise ye our Lord, used as a sign of exultation. Paulus Diaconus writes, that when the Britains were invaded by the Saxons and Picts, and ready to fight a battel with them, they were admonished by Germanus a French Bishop (sent hither with St. Lupus, to confute the Pelagian Heresie) that they should say as he said, and forthwith he cry'd out aloud Alleluiah, which when the whole Army of Britains had done, the sound thereof struck such a terror into their enemies, that they presently fled, and the Britains had the victory. De gestis Rom. l. 15. & Bede Eccl. Hist. l. 1. c. 20.
