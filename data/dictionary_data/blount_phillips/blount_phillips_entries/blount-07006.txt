Nones (nonae) in March, May, July and October, are the six days next following the first day, or the Calends; In other moneths they are the four days next after the first; But the last of these days is properly called Nones, and the other reckoned backward, according to the number distant from the Nones, as the third, fourth or fith Nones. They are called Nones, because they began the ninth day before the Ides. Hoptons Conc. p. 70.
