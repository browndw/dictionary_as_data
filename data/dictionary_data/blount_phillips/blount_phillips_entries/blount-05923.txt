Law of Arms (jus militare) is a Law that gives precepts and rules how rightly to proclaim War, to make and observe Leagues and Truce, to set upon the enemy, to retire, to punish offenders in the Camp, to appoint Souldiers their pay, to give every one dignity to his desert, to divide spoils in proportion, and such like: for further knowledge whereof read those that write de Jure Belli.
