Novels of the Civil Law are in number 168. into which the 91 Collations of the Authenticks (which were set out after the Codex by Justinian, then Emperor, and brought into the body of the Civil Law) were divided. They were called Novelles (says Cujatius) quod novissime promulgatae sint post Codices.
