Cadmus, the King of the Phoenicians, the son of Agenor and brother of Europa, he brought the Greek letters out of Phoenicia; he killed a serpent which had slain some of his companions, sowing the teeth of it in the Earth, out of which there sprung up armed men. He built Thebes, in the Country of Aonia, which was afterwards called Boeotia; but being driven thence with his wife Hermione, by Zethus and Amphion, he was changed into a serpent.
