Haggs (flammae lambentes) are made of sweat or some other vapor, issuing out of the head; a not unusual sight among us, when we ride by night in the Summer time: They are extinguished, like flames, by shaking the horse Mains; But I beleeve rather it is onely a vapour reflecting light, but fat and sturdy, compacted about the Mains of horses or mens hairs. Per. Institutions, p. 149.
