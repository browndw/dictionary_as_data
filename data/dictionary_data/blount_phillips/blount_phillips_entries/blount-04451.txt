Gantlope (Ghent Lope) a punishment of Souldiers, haply first invented at Ghent, or Gant in Flanders, and therefore so called; or it may be derived from the Dutch gaen looper, i. to take ones heels or run; and Lope in Dutch signifies running; for the Offendor is to run through the whole Regiment with his upper part naked, and every fellow-Soldier to have a whip at him, &c.
