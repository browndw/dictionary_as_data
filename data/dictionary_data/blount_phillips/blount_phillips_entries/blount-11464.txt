Weald of Kent, is the woody part of the Country. Cam. Britan pag. 247. Verstegan says, Wald, Weald and Wold, differing in Vowel, signifie one thing, to wit, a Forest or Wood; for so the (Teut.) Wald also signifies. Yet I have observed, in Leicester and Yorkeshires, those places are now called Wolds, which have little or no Wood on them; but it is very probable the woods thereof have been cut down, since they received that denomination. From this word Wald, came Waltham Forest, antiently called Waldham Forest. And Waldegrave (an antient name in Norfolk) took denomination from the disposing and over-seeing the Forest for so much the name imports.
