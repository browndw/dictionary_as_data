Degree, A term often used in Astronomy and Physick. In Astronomy it signifies the thirtieth part of a Sign (viz.) of Aries, Taurus, Gemini, &c. for into so many parts or degrees are all these Signs divided. In Physick it signifies a proportion of heat, or cold, moysture or driness in the nature of Simples; and there are four such proportions or Degrees. The first Degree is so small, that it can scarce be perceived. The second, that which manifestly may be perceived without hurting the sence. The third, that which somewhat offends the sense. The fourth, which so much offends, that it may destroy the body. For example, sweet Almonds, Rice, Bugloss, ripe Grapes, are hot in the first degree: Parsley, Saffron, Honey, in the second degree: Cummin, Galingal, Pepper, in the third degree: And Garlick, Spourge, Euphorbium in the fourth degree. So Barley is cold in the first degree, Cucumbers in the second, Sengreen in the third, and Hemlock in the fourth degree. Where note, that in heat, cold, and driness, there may be four degrees, and in moisture but two. Bull.
