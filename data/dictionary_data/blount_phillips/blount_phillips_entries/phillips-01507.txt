Besant, an ancient coin of Gold, otherwise called Bisantine, from Byzantium: i. e. Constantinople, where it used to be coined. It is uncertain what value it is of; some attribute to it the value of a Ducket. It is also a term in Heraldry, by which they understand plates of Gold, containing 104 pound and two ounces of Troy weight, in value 3750 pound ster. They were round and smooth, without any representation on them.
