Mansion (mansio) a tarrying, a baiting, an abiding. Also (as Bracton defines it, lib. 5. cap. 28. num. 1.) it is a dwelling consisting of one or more houses without any neighbor; And yet he grants forthwith that Mansio Mansioni possit esse vicinata. I find it most commonly used for the Lords chief dwelling house within his Fee, whether it have neighbors adjoyning or not, otherwise called the capital Messuage, or the chief Mannor place. Mansio among the antient Romans was a place appointed for the lodging of the Prince or Souldiers in their journey or march, furnished, with convenient entertainment by the neighbors adjoyning, &c.
