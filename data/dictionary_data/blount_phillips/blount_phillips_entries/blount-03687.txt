Erarians (Aerarii) were those, who being Citizens of Rome, were by the Censors deprived of giving their voyces in their Century or Tribe; paid all Tribute with Citizens, according to the valuation of their goods, and served in the Wars at their own charges; and it seems they took that name either because aera pendebant, or aera non merebant. Livie.
