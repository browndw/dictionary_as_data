This Law they pretend was made by Pharamond their first King, and that the words, Si aliqua, so often mentioned, gave it the name of Salique Law; Others say it took denomination from the name of the place Salethani, where it was made, oa cent from the name of a cent algast, who was Chancellor to Pharamond, and one of the chief in making this Law.
