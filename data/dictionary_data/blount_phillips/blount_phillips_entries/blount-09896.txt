Stellion (stellio) the spotted or starry Lizard, so called; also an envious fellow, or one that cannot endure another should be the better by him; from the Stellion, which, having (as he doth half yearly) cast his skin (a soverein remedy for the Falling-sickness) presently devours it, to deprive mankind of it.
