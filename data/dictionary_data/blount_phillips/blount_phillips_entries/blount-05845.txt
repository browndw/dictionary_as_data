Lammas day, the first of August, otherwise called the Gule or Yule of August, which may be a corruption of the Brittish word Gwyl Awa cent , signifying the Feast of August; or may come from Vincula, that day being called in Latin Festum St. Petri ad vincula. It is called Lammas day, because on that day after Mass, the Priests in former times were wont to make an end of gathering their Tithe Lambs. But Dr. Hammond, in his Resolution to six Queries. p. 465. derives it from the Sax. La cent fmess, i.e. loaf-mass, or bread-mass; so named, as a Feast of thanksgiving to God for the first fruits of the Corn, and seems to have been observed with bread of new wheat; and accordingly it is a usuage in some places for Tenants to be bound to bring in wheat of that year to their Lord, on or before the first of August. Others say, it is a corruption of the Fr. Lien-mess, whick relates to Vincula.
