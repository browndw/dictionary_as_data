Moralize (moralizo) to expound morally, to give a moral sence unto. As in the Fables of Aesop, the parties named are Foxes, Asses, and such like Beasts; with Birds and Fishes, yet there is a latent moral sence therein, appliable to the persons of men and women, and which may serve for rules of good manners, and this is called the moral or morality of the Fable.
