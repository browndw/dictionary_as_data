Charmer (one that useth conjurations) is said to be he that speaks words of a strange language, without sence; that if one say so or so to a Serpent, it cannot hurt him. He that whispers over a wound, or reads over an Infant, that it may not be frighted, or lays the Bible on a child, that it may sleep, &c, Moses and Aaron, p. 175.
