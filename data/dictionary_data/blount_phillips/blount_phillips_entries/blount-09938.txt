Stoicks (Stoici) a Sect of Philosophers at Athens, wherof of Zeno was the chief; they held a wise man ought to be free from all passions, never to be moved either with Joy or Grief, and esteeming all things to be ordered by an inevitable necessity of Fate. They were called Stoicks, of the Gr. (a in non-Latin alphabet a) i. a Porch; because Zeno taught his followers in a common Porch of the City.
