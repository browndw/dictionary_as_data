Melchites, a Sect in Syria so called, who are subject to the Patriark of Antioch, and are of the same Tenets with the Grecians, except onely that they celebrate divine service, as solemnly on the Saturday as Sunday; They take their denomination from Melchi, which in the Syriac signifies a King, because in matters of Religion, the people followed the Emperors Injunctions, and were of the Kings Religion, as the saying is. Heil.
