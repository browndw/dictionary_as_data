Zoroaster, the first King of the Bactrians, who, as Pliny saith, was the first inventour of Magick among the Persians, he is said to have laught the first day he was born, and his brain is said to have beat so strongly, that it repelled any ones hand which was laid on, which was held to be a signe of his future sagacity, he wrote the liberal arts upon seven pillars of brick, and also upon seven of brasse; he wrote also one volume concerning nature, one of precious stones, with several other works; some say, he was consumed with fire from heaven, and that he foretold to the Assyrians, that if they preserved his ashes, their Kingdom should never fail, others say, he was slain in the wars he had with Ninus, King of Assyria.
