Gog and Magog. Gog by interpretation of the Hebrew word is tectus, covered; and Magog is uncovered. In Scripture by Gog and Magog are understood certain Nations, (some Expositors take them to be the Aquilonar Scythians, Iberiads, and Muscovites) or Princes that with their Nations shall more fiercely then other concur with Antichrist in persecuting the Church of Christ. Ezek. 38.39 Rev. 20.8. To be a Gog. See Gogue.
