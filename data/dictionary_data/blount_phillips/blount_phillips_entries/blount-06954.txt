Niding (old English) signifies an abject, base-minded, false-hearted coward. In former time this word was of great force in England: For when there was a dangerous Rebellion against King William Rufus, &c. after he had but proclaimed, that his Subjects should repair to his Camp upon no other penalty, but that who ever refused, should be reputed a Niding; they swarmed to him immediately from all sides in such numbers, as he had in few days a great Army, and the Rebels were so terrified therewith, that they forthwith yielded.
