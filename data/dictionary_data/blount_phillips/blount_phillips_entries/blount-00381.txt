Amalekites or Amalecites, were descendents of Esau by his Grandchild Amalec (which word is Hebrew, and signifies populus lambens, a licking people:) these Amalekites inhabited some of the lands betwixt Phaenicia and the red Sea, and were the first that took Arms against Moses and the children of Israel, as they were travelling betwixt the said Red Sea, and the land of Promise, over whom Joshua (appointed General of the Israelites by Moses) got a famous victory, as you may read in Exod. 17. Hence 'tis that enemies to the children of God or good people, or enemies to good proceedings, are commonly called Amalekites.
