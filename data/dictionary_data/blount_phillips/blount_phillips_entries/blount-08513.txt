Publication (publicatio) a publishing or making common. In Chancery we say a cause is come to Publication, when the Plaintiff hath exhibited his Bill, the Defendant answered, and witnesses are examined, then the Court either by special order, or of course, grants Publication, or a publishing of the Proofs, that is, liberty for both parties to take out the Depositions of the Witnesses whereby to prepare for a Hearing.
