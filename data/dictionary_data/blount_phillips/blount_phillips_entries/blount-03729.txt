Escotcheon (Fr. Escusson) a Buckler or Shield, whereof in Europe we have onely two kinds in use (the Lozenge excepted) viz. that we use in England, France, Germany, &c. & the Oval they bear in Italy, which form they yet (from the old Romans) hold in use. The word Escutcheon, is derived from the French un EscA, that from the Latin Scutum, and that again from a in non-Latin alphabet a in Greek, which signifies Leather, because the Antients had their Shields of tanned Leather, the skins laid thick one over another, as appears by that of AElysses upbraiding Ajax, Quae nisi fecissem, frustrA Telamone creatusGestasset laevA cent taurorum tergora septem.
