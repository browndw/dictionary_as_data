Tragedie (tragoedia) is a lofty kind of Poetry so called from a in non-Latin alphabet a, a goat, and a in non-Latin alphabet a, an Ode or Song; because the Actors therof had a goat given them as a reward. The differences between a Tragedy and a Comedy are these; First, in respect of the matter; because a Tragedy treats of exilements, murders, matters of grief, &c. a Comedy of love-toyes, merry fictions, and petty matters; In a Tragedy the greatest part of the Actors are Kings and Noble Persons; In a Comedy, private persons of meaner state and condition. The subject of a Comedy is often feigned, but of a Tragedy it is commonly true and once really performed; The beginning of a Tragedy is calm and quiet, the end fearful and turbulent; but in a Comedy contrarily, the beginning is turbulent, and the end calm. Both Comedies and Tragedies ought to have five Acts and no more, according to that of Horace.
