Annuity (annuus reditus) a yearly Rent to be paid for term of life or years, or in Fee. There are divers differences between a Rent and an Annuity, whereof the first is, that every Rent is going out of Land, and an Annuity goes out of no Land, but charges onely the person of the granter, or his heirs, that have Assets by descent. The second difference is, that for the recovery of an Annuity, no Action lies, but onely the Writ of Annuity against the Granter, his heirs or successors: but of a Rent the same Actions lie, as do of Land, as the case requires. The third difference is, that an Annuity is never taken for Assets, because it is no Free-hold in Law, nor shall it be put in execution upon a Statute-Merchant, Statute-Staple, or Elegit, as a Rent may. Doctor and Student. Dial. 1. c. 3. and Dier fol. 345. num. 2. speaks also to this effect.
