Stanford, in Saxon Steanford, a Town in Lincolnshire, situate upon the River Welland; it is so called as being built of rough stone, Stean signifying in the Saxon tongue a stone. In this Town, under the reign of King Edward the third, an University was instituted, and publick profession of Arts began to flourish; but this Academy continued not long, it being soon after provided by oath, that no Student in Oxford should publickly professe at Stanford to the prejudice of Oxford. There is also another Stanford situate upon the River Avon in Northamptonshire.
