To Trepan, or Trappan, (from the Ital. Trappare or trappolare, i. to entrap, or catch in a gin) in the modern acceptation, signifies to cheat, or entrap in this manner; a whore admits a man to be naught with her, and in the very instant, rings a Bell or gives a watch-word, and in comes a Pander who pretends to be her husband, and with vapouring and threats, upon the act of Adultery or otherwise, forces money or bond from the deluded third person. Some take this word to be derived from a Pander, that does entrap, or a trapping Pander.
