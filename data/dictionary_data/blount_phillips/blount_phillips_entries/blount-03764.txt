Ethiopians or Moors, the people of Aethiopia; the particulars of their opinions, wherewith they have infected the true purity, I find thus registred. 1. They use to Circumcise both males and females. 2. They baptize males forty, females eighty days after their circumcision. 3. After the receipt of the Sacrament, they are not to spit till Sun-set. 4. They profess but one Nature and one Will in Christ. 5. They accept only the three first general Councils. 6. Their Priests live only by the labour of their hands; for they allow them nothing, and permit them not to beg. 7. They rebaptise themselves every Epiphany day in Lakes and Ponds, because that day they suppose Christ to have been bapa cent ised by John in Jordan. Heyl.
