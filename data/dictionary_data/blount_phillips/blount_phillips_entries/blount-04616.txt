Gossip (from the Sax. Godsib) our Christian Ancestors (understanding a spiritual affinity to grow between the Parents and such as undertook for the Child at Baptism) called each other by the name of Godsib, which is as much to say, as they were Sib together, that is, of Kin through God, or a Cousen before God; And the child in like manner called such his God-Fathers or God-Mothers, &c. Verst.
