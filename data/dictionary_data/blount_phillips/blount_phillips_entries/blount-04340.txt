Frier Observant (frater observans) is an Order of Franciscans, & it is to be noted, that of these four Orders mentioned in the word above, the Franciscans are, Minores tam observantes quam conventuales, & Capuchini. Zecch. de Repub. Eccl. tract. de regular. cap. 2. These Friers Observant (mentioned An. 25. H. B. ca. 12.) are so called, because they are not combined together in any Cloister, Covent or Corporation, as the Conventuals are, but onely tye themselves to observe the Rules of their Order, and more strictly then the Conventuals do; and upon a singularity of zeal separate themselves from them, living in certain places and companies of their own chusing, and of this you may read Hospinian, de Orig & prog. Monachatus, fol. 878. ca. 38.
