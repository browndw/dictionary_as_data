Font (fons) a Fountain or Water-spring. What the Font of a Church is every one knows, but not why so called. The Rites of Baptism in the primitive times were performed in Fountains and Rivers, both because the Converts were many, and those ages unprovided of other Baptisteries; and in this Rite we still retain the name; for hence tis we call our Baptisteries, Fonts; which when Religion found peace, were built and consecrated for the more reverence and respect of the Sacrament. Rationale.
