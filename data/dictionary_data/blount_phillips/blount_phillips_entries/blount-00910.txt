In Astronomy it signifies the distance between the Planets and heavenly signs: and there are four such Aspects. The first called, a Trine Aspect (because it divides the Heavens into three even parts) is the distance of four signs from each other; as Aries beholds Leo and Sagittarius with a Trine Aspect, because these are distant four signs, the one before, the other after Aries. The second called a Quartile, is the distance of three signs, as Aries beholds Cancer and Capricorn with a Quartile Aspect, because they are distant three signs from him. The third called a Sextile Aspect, is the distance of two signs, as Aries beholds Gemini and Aquarius with this Sextile Aspect, being but two signs distant from them. The fourth, called an Opposite Aspect, is the farthest distant that can be, namely a distance of six signs asunder; As Aries beholds Libra with this Opposite Aspect, and Libra beholds Aries with the same. The like is of all the other Signs or Planets placed in them. For example, Taurus beholds Cancer and Pisces, with a Sextile; Leo and Aquarius with a Quartile, Virgo and Capricorn with a Trine, and Scorpio with an Opposite Aspect. The distance of one or five Signs is not called an Aspect.
