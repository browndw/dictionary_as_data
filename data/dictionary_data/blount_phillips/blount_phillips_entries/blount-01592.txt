Cardinal (cardinalis) a high dignity in the Church of Rome, whereof there are about 70 in number, and were first instituted by P. Paschal the first. Minsh derives the word from Cardo, inis, the hook or hinge of a door: for as the door hangs or depends on the hinges, so the Church on the Cardinals. The word taken Adjectively, is pertaining to a hook or hinge; also chief or principal; the four Cardinal Vertues are, 1 Prudencea 2 Temperance, 3 Justice, 4 Fortitude. So called, because they are the principal foundations of a vertuous well-ordered life, and as it were the hinges on which all other moral vertues depend; the four principal winds, East, West, North, and South, are also called Cardinal Winds.
