Iujubes, certain plumbs of Italy, sold here by Apothecaries. This fruit is in colour white or red, in fashion round or like an Olive, in taste sweet, having a hard long stone, like an Olive stone, but much less. If these plumbs be kept long, they wax dry and full of wrinckles. They are temperate in heat and cold, good against the Cough, roughness of the throat, and all exulcerations and inflammations of the Kidneys and Bladder: but being eaten for meat are of hard digestion. Bull.
