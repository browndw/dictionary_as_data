Orpheus, a famous Poet, and Musician of Thrace, the son of Calliope and Apollo, he took so heavily the losse of his wife Euridice (of which see Euridice) that he utterly abandoned the company of women, for which he was torn in pieces by the Maenades at the Feast of Bacchus, and his several members being cast down the RiveraHebrus were gathered up by the Muses and buried, and his Harp translated up to Heaven.
