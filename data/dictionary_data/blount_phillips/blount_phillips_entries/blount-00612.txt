Antinomians (aba in non-Latin alphabet acontrA , &a in non-Latin alphabet alex, quasi adversarii legis, adversaries to the Law) are a sort of Reformists hatcht in Luthers days, about the year 1525. by a disciple once of Luthers, called John, sir-named Islebius, a Husbandman (from the Town Islebium, where he and Luther were both born in the County of Mansfield in Germany) The Tenets of that Sect are; That there are no Devils; That the men of the Gospel are not bound to do the good works of Gods Law, as being neither necessary, nor profitable; That whatsoever sins a man falls into, be they Whoredoms, Adulteries, Thefts, Rebellions, or whatever other, yet if he do but believe the promises of the Gospel, he is sure to be saved; with such other damnable points. This Heresie is still lurking in many corners of Christendom; one John Eaton is said to have been the first professor of it in England.
