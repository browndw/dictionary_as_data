Congregationalists, otherwise called Independents, or Dissenting Brethren in the late Assembly of Divines, are such as gather Congregations, &c. and go a middle way betwixt Presbytery and Brownism. The chief of these were Thomas Goodwin, Philip Nye, Sidrach Simson, Jeremiah Burrowes, and William Bridge. See Mr. Fullers Church History, l. 11. p. 208. See Independents.
