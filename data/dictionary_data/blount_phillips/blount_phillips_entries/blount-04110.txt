Fee (feodum, alias feudum) is in our Law an equivocal word, but most usually taken for an estate of inheritance in Lands to one and his Heirs for ever, or to one and the heirs of his body. But it is also used for the compass or extent of a Mannor; and in the common acceptance, the word is well known.
