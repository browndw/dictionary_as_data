Carthage, the chief City of Africa, anciently called Carthedon: it was built by Dido, and grew at length to that power and greatnesse, that it waged war with the Romans, for a long while, with equal advantage. There is also a City of Hispania Tarraconensis, formerly called Carthago Vetus, now Villa Franca.
