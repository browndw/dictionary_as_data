Ich dien, the true old Sax, was Ih or Ica cent thian, or thiene, i. I serve; some will have it come from the Brittish Etch dyn, i. your man, in that language; it is the Motto belonging to the Devise of the Princes of Wales, which we commonly, though corruptly call the Princes Arms; the figure is three Ostrich feathers, which (saith Cambden) Edw. the Black Prince won at the battle of Cressy, from John K. of Bohemia, whom he there slew, whereto he adjoyned this old English Motto, alluding to that of the Apostle, The heir while he is a childe differs nothing from a servant. These feathers were an antient ornament of military men, and used for Crests, as is evident by that of Virgil.
