Porphyry Chair, a Chair of Porphyry Marble in the Cloister of St. John Lateran at Rome, called Sedes Stercoraria; because when the Pope takes possession of his Episcopal See in that Church, at the intoneing the Verse, Suscitans de terra inopem & de stercore erigens pauperem, Psal. 113. he was carried from a side Chappel to the high Altar, in that Chair; to signifie that God had raised him from a low condition, to that supreme Dignity. The usual tale of this Chair is a meer fiction.
