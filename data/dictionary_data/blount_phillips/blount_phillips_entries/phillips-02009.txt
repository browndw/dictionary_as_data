Capias, a writ, of which there be two sorts, the one before judgement, which is called Capias ad respondendum, where an exigent is to be proclaimed 5 times, and if the party appear not, he is to be outlaw'd. The other is called a writ of execution after judgement, which is of divers kinds, Capias ad faciendum, Capias pro fine, Capias ut la cent gatum, & inquiras de bonis & catallis: of which see a book called Natura Brevium.
