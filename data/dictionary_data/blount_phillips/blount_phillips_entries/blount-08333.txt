Privative (privativus) that deprives, bereaves or takes away; substantively, it is a name for such monasyllabical words which being compounded with simple words, do deprive and take away the proper sense or meaning of them, as in Latin de, dis, di, ex, in, &c. are called Privatives, so are dis, un, in, &c. in English.
