Acastus, the son of Peleus, King of Thessaly, a famous Hunter with Bow and Arrows, he married Hippolita, who loving Pelius, because he yielded not to her love, accused him to her husband, for having offered violence to her, wherefore Acastus threw him to be devoured of wilde beasts, but Mercury coming in the interim, freed Pelius with Vulcans sword, who returning slew Acastus and Hippolita.
