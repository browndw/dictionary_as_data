Antipodes (Gr.) people dwelling on the other side of the earth with their feet directly against ours, so as a right line, drawn from the one to the other, passeth from North to South, through the Center of the world. These are distant 180 degrees, which is half the compass of the earth. They differ in all things as seasons of the year, length of days, rising and setting of the Sun, with the like. Plato is said to be the first Author of this word Antipodes.
