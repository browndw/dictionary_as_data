Vesta, the daughter of Saturn and Ops, taken ofttimes by the Poets for the earth and sometimes for the fire, in honour of whom Numa Pompilius instituted many Rites and Ceremonies, and conscecrated to her service certain Virgins called Vestalls, who were to take care of the Vestal fire, which when it went out, was not to be kindled by any earthly fire, but to be renewed by the beams of the Sun. They were injoyned to preserve their virginity inviolable so long as they remained in the service of the goddesse, and who ever was found faulty among them was buried alive.
