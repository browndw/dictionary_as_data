Serviteur (Fr.) a servitor, servant, Serving-man, Attendant or Waiter. We use the word Servitor in our Universities, where the poor or meaner sort of Schollars (that have not wherwith sufficiently to maintain themselves) execute the Office of a Servitor or Attendant to those of greater wealth and quality.
