Aries (Lat.) a Ram; an Engine heretofore used in besieging Cities; so called because it had horns of Iron like a Rams-head, which batter'd the walls; or otherwise, because they rushed against the walls with it, as a Ram with his head, and back again. The form of which you may find in Marcellinus, l. 23. c. 3. Also the first sign of the Zodiack, so called, because when the Sun enters into that sign about mid-March, he begins to beat with his beams upon the beginnings of the New-year as a Ram doth butt, or push with his horns. Du Bartas.
