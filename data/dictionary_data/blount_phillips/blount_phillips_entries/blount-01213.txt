Bel, In the Chaldean tongue signifies the Sun; and therefore Ninus and Semarimis gave that name to their Father Bel or Belus, that he might be honored as the Sun, which the Babylonians worshipped as a God. Bel also is a contract of Behel, which comes of Bahal, a Lord: it was not onely the particular Idol of the Babylonians, but a general name of the Idols in the East, agreeing to all the Idols of the Gentiles, as some write, Jer. 9, 5. 1 King. 18, 25.
