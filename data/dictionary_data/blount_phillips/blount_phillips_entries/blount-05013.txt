Hyena, a beast like a woolf having a Main, and long hairs over all the body. It is the subtillest (as some say) of all beasts, and will counterfeit the voice of a man, to draw shepherds out of their houses in the night, to the end he may kill them. It is said he changes sex often, being sometimes male, and sometimes female.
