Turbant, A Turkish hat, or Ornament for the head, of white and fine linnen, wreathed into a rundle, broad at the bottom to enclose the head, and lessening for ornament towards the top; The custom of wearing it, had this origen; The barbarous people having the Grecian Army once at a great advantage at or near the Hill Thermopylae, there was no other remedy, but some few must make good a narrow passage, while the main of the Army might escape; which some brave Spirits undertook, and knowing they went to an inevitable death, had care of nothing but sepulture, of old much regarded; wherefore each of them carried his winding sheet wrapt about his head, and then with loss of their own lives, saved their fellows; whereupon for an honorable memorial of their exploit, the Levantines used to wrap white linnen about their heads, and the fashion so derived upon the Turk. Sir Hen. Blounts voyage fol. 18. See Shash.
