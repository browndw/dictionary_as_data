Stooming of Wine, There is (says Mr. Howel in his Letters) a hard green wine that grows about Rochel, and the Islands thereabouts, which the cunning Hollander sometime useth to fetch, and he hath a trick to put a bag of hearbs or some other infusions into it (as he doth brimstone in Rhenish) to give it a whiter tincture, and more sweetness; then they reimbark it for England, where it passeth for good Bachrag, and this is called Stooming of wine
