Antonians, an order of Religious persons, instituted about the year 324, by the Aegyptian Monk St. Anthony, who at the first sold his possessions, and distributed their worth among the poor, and afterwards betook himself to a most holy austere course of life, perpetually addicted to Prayer, Fasting, Watching, and other corporeal mortifications; teaching his Disciples or followers to fight against the Devil and his temptations with the sign of the Holy Cross; his life was written by Athanasius, one of the Greek Fathers, who lived in his days.
