Amerciament (from the Fr. merci, i. Mercy) signifies the pecuniary punishment of an offender against the King or other Lord in his Court that is found to be in misericordia, i. to have offended and to stand at the mercy of the Lord. There seems to be a difference between Amerciaments and Fines, Kitchin fol. 214. For Fines, as taken for punishments, are punishments certain, which grow expresly from some Statute, and Amerciaments are arbitrably imposed by Affeerors. Cow.
