Correlatives (correlativa) Relatio (according to the Philosophers) is, Cujus totum esse est ad aliud esse, whose whole being is to be to another, whence Correlatives are such things as are mutually one to another, and cannot be, nor be explicated, but in order to one another. As Father and Son, superior and inferior, Husband and Wife, &c.
