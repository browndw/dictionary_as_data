Coral or Corral (Corallium) There are two principal sorts hereof, the one white, the other red, but the red is best. It grows like a tree in the bottom of the Sea, green when under the water, and bearing a white berry; and when out, turns red. It is cold and dry in operation, good to be hanged about childrens necks, as well to rub their Gums, as to preserve them from the Falling-sickness. Sands 235. There is also a black and yellow kind of Coral. See more in Dr. Browns Vul. Err. fol. 91.
