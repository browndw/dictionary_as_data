Melancholy (melancholia) black choler caused by adustion of the blood; also sadness, pensiveness, solitariness. Melancholy is by Physicians reckoned for one of the four humors of mans body, and resembles the Earth, as Choler doth the fire; Blood the air; Phlegm the water. It is said to be the grossest of all four, which, if it abound too much, causeth heaviness and sadness of mind.
