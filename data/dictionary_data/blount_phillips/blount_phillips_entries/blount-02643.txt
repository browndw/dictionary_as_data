Cycle (cyclus) a round or circle. In Astronomy it is thus defined. The division of the year into 52 weeks, because it sets off one day supernumerary, makes an alteration in all the rest; so that the days of the week (which use to be assigned by the letters of the Alphabet) fall not alike in several years; but Sunday this year must fall out on the next years Munday, & so forward till seven years; and (because the Bissextile superadds another day every fourth year) till four times seven, that is, 28 years are gone about. This revolution is called the Cycle of the Sun, taking name from Sunday, the letter whereof (called therefore Dominical) it appoints for every year. It is sound by adding nine (for so far the Circle was then gone about) to the year of our Lord, and dividing the whole by 28. so to the year 1639, if nine be added, the numerus factus will be 1648, which, divided by 28, leaves 24 for the Cycle of the Sun.
