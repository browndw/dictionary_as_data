Hereford, the cheif City of Herefordshire, anciently called Tresawith, from the Beech-trees growing thereabout. It was built as some say by King Edward the Elder, in that tract of the Country called of old Ereinuc or Archenfeild, out of the ruines of the ancient Ariconium; the fame of this City was augmented by the Martyrdom of Ethelbert King of East England, who going to wooe the daughter of Offa King of the Mercians, was here forelaid and murthered by the procurement of Quendred Offa's wife.
