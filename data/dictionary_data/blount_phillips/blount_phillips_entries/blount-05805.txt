Kyrie eleison (omnibus linguis, A Gr. a in non-Latin alphabet a, i. domine, and a in non-Latin alphabet a, i. miserere, aba in non-Latin alphabet a, i. misericordia, q. miserere Domine) Lord have mercy on us. So Christe eleison, i. Christ have mercy on us. In the Greek Church these words are of great esteem, and often repeated by their Priests; and are also used in the Latin Church, both in the Mass and Litany.
