Chapter (Capitulum) signifies in the common and Canon Law (whence it is borrowed) Congregationem Clericorum in EcclesiA cent Cathedrali, conventuali, regulari vel collegiata; why this collegiate company should be called a Chapter (i. a little head of the Canonists) is for that this Company or Corporation is a kind of Head, not onely to rule and govern the Diocess in the vacancy of the Bishoprick, but also in many things to advise the Bishop when the See is full.
