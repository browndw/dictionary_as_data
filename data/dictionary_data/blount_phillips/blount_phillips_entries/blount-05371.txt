Individuum (Lat.) one singular thing; that which cannot be divided, a body inseparable, a Moat; Also a term in Logick, when we directly express and seem to point to that thing which we speak of: As in saying, This Horse, that Man; for though the words [horse or man] may be applied to any horse or man, yet being so expresly pointed at, they cannot then be drawn to signifie other then those two.
