Pole (polus) the end or point of the Axletree, wherea on Astronomers imagin Heaven to be moved, that part of the Heaven which never moves; There are two such Poles, one in the North, noted by a Star called Polus Arcticus, visible to us far above the earth, the other in the South named Antarcticus, far out of sight, being as much under the earth in the South as the North Pole is above it. It is also taken for Heaven, and so used by Poets.
