Ignoramus, the first person plural of ignoro, signifies properly we are ignorant; but it's commonly used as a Noun. As when we say such a one is an Ignoramus, i. a fool or a dolt. In our Common Law it is properly used by the grand Enquest, empannelled in the Inquisition of causes criminal and publick; and written upon the Bill, whereby any crime is offered to their consideration, when they mislike their evidence, as defective or too weak to make good the Presentment. The effect of which word so written, is, that all farther inquiry upon that party, for that fault, is thereby stopped, and he delivered without further answer; It has a resemblance with that custom of the ancient Romans; where the Judges, when they absolved a person accused, did write A, upon a little Table provided for that purpose, i. Absolvimus: If they judged him guilty, they writ C. i. Condemnamus: if they found the cause difficult and doubtful, they wrote N.L. i. Non Liquet. Alex. ab Alexandro. Genial. dierum lib. 3. c. 14.
