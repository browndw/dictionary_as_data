Epicycle (epicyclus) a term in Astronomy, signifying a lesser circle, whose center or middle part is in the circumference of a greater. In the upper part of this Epicycle, the five Planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury go forward according to the course of the Signs, as Aries to Taurus, &c. in the lower part they are retrogade, that is, go backward, as from Gemini to Taurus, from Taurus to Aries again. Between these two Motions are said to be two Stations. viz. when a Planet ceaseth going forward, and begins to retrograde, or coming to the furthest point of his retrogradation, goes forward again. So that in the Epicycle these Planets wheel about sometimes according, sometimes contrary to the order of the Signs. Bull.
