Eccho or Echo (Gr.) a resounding, or giving again of any noyse, or voyce in a Wood, Valley, or Hollow place. Poets feign, that this Eccho was a Nymph so called, who being rejected by one whom she loved, pined away for sorrow in the Woods, where her voyce still remains, answering the outcrys of all complaints.
