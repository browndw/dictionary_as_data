Rumbe (rhombus) a term in Geometry, and signifies a whole line in the Compass consisting of two winds, as the Line of North and South, or that of East and West. The Spaniards first gave that name, as Peter of Medina takes it upon them, yet not out of their own Language, but fancying to themselves that the Lines of the Compass (as indeed they do) much resembled the spars of a Spinning Wheel, which in Lat. is called Rhombus, from the Gr. a in non-Latin alphabet a, to turn about, they call that Rumbus, and the word hath taken. Greg. 283.
