Naturalize (Fr. naturalizer) to make a natural Subject; to admit into the number of natural Subjects. At Rome there were two sorts of Citizens; some Cives nati; Citizens by birth; others Civitate donati, Citizens by donation or gift, who because they were added unto and registred with the first sort of Citizens, were thence called Adscriptitii Cives.
