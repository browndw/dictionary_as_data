Hotchpot (Fr. Hochepot. Belg. Hutspot, i. flesh cut into pretty peices and sodden with herbs or roots, not unlike that which the Romans called Farraginem, a Gallimaufrey.) Littleton says it litterally signifies a Pudding mixed with divers ingredients; but metaphorically a commixtion or putting together of Lands, for the equal division of them, Examples you have divers in him, f. 55. And see Britt. f. 119.
