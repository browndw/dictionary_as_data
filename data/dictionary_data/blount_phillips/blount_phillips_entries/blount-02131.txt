Comitial (comitialis) pertaining to an Assembly of people convened for the chusing Officers or making Laws. Among the Antient Romans, if any of the people assembled were taken with the falling sickness, the whole Assembly or Comitium was dissolved; hence the Falling sickness is at this day called Morbus Comitialis, or the Comitial evil.
