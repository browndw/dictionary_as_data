Knight Banneret, from the Dutch word Bannerherr, Lord or Master of the Banner, is a Knight made in the field, with the ceremonies of cutting the point of his Standard, and making it as it were a Banner, and is allowed to display his arms in the Kings army. This Dignity was given at first by the Kings of England and France, to such Gentlemen as valiantly carried themselves in two Royal Battels, or to such as had ten vassals and means to maintain a Troop of Horses at their own charge. Some say the first original of it was from Edward the third.
