Epiphany (epiphania) an appearing of light, or a manifestation. The feast of Twelfth day after Christmas, is so called, in memory and honor of Christs manifestation or apparition made to the Gentiles by a miraculous blazing Star, by vertue whereof he drew and conducted the three Magi or Sages, commonly called the three Kings, who upon sight of that star came out of the East into the Country of Palestine or Jewry, to adore him in the Manger, where they presented him, as on this day with Mirh, Gold, and Frankinsence, in testimony of his Regality, Humanity and Divinity. The Vigil of this Feast was of old called Vigilia Luminum; And the Antients were wont to send lights one to another. Greg.
