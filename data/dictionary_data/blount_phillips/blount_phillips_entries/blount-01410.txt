Bull (bulla) properly a gold ornament or jewel for children, of a round compass, and hollow within, made like a heart, and used to be hung about their necks; and hence the Briefs or Mandats of the Pope are called Bulls, from the lead, and sometimes golden Seal affixed thereto, which Seal, Matth. Paris, Anno 1237. describes thus: In Bulla Domini Papae stat Imago Pauli A Dextris Crucis in medio Bullae figuratae, & Petri a sinistris: See more of these Bulls in Sir Henry Spelmans Glossarium.
