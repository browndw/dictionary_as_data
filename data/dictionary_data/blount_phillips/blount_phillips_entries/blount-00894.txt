Ascendant (ascendens) or Horoscope, is the point of the Ecliptick, arising at some determinate moment of the natural day; in which the Infant is conceived or born; (so called from two Greek Nouns a in non-Latin alphabet a, i. Hora, and a in non-Latin alphabet a, scopus) which is the scope to be aimed at; for the condition of the whole life is believed to depend on that moment; and therefore that moment and point of the Ecliptick, is to be proposed and established as the principal scope level'd at in Astrological consideration. Ricciolus in his Almagesto Novo.
