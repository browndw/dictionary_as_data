Cimmerian. That sees no Sun, or lives without the light of the Sun, obscure, dark, from Cimmerii a people of Italy, dwelling in a Valley near the mountain Pausilype, so invironed with hills, that the Sun never comes to it. Hence the proverb Cimmerian darkness, where Ovid placeth the Palace of Somnus.
