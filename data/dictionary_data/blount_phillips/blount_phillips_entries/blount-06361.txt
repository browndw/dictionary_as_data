Marquetry, is a most curious work wrought in wood of divers colours, and divers sorts, into the shape of knots, flowers and other devices, with that excellency of cunning, as they seem all to be one piece, and rather the work of Nature then Art; Chequer-work, Inlaid-word. Marquetrie, properly belongs to Joyners, as Mosaique to Masons and Stone-cutters, though some Authors confound them. See Mosaique.
