Almner Almoner or Amner (eleemosynarius) is an Officer of a King or Princes house, whose function is carefully to collect the fragments and distribute them every day to the poor: Charitably to visit the sick and leprous, those that are in prison, poor widows, needy persons, and those that have no constant abode; likewise to receive and faithfully distribute cast horses, robes, mony and other things given in Alms; he ought also to stir up the King with often admonitions, especially on Festival days, to be bountiful in giving Alms, and to beseech that his rich Robes may not be given to Parasites, Masquers, Stage-players, or the like, but may go towards the increase of his Alms.
