For under the Aequator, the days are of the just length of twelve hours, but after in every Clime they increase the length of half an hour; so that there are numbred forty eight Parallels, or twenty four Climates, before the dayes extend to twenty four hours length, which once attained, they increase by weeks and moneths, till they come to the length of half a year: We therefore are to reckon twenty four Climates Northward, and as many Southward. Heyl.
