Chimaera, a Hill of Lycia, on the top whereof were many Lions, in the midst fed Goates, and at the bottom were Serpents, which Bellerophon made habitable. Whence the Poets feigned that Bellerophon killed the Monster Chimaera, who had the head of a Lion, the belly of a Goat, and the tail of a Dragon. VVhence Chimaera's are taken for idle conceits.
