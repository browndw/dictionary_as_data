Witch, is derived from the Dutch Witchelen or Witchelen, which properly signifies whinnying and neighing like a Horse; also to foretel or prophecy; and Witcheler, signifies a Soothsayer; for that the Germans (from whom our Ancestors the Saxons usually descended) did principally (as Tacitus tells us) divine and foretel things to come by the whinnying and neighing of their Horses; Hinitu and Fremitu, are his words. For the definition, Master Perkins (cap. 1.) saith, Witchcraft is an art serving for the working of wonders, by the assistance of the Devils, so far as God will permit. Delrio defines it to be, An art which by the power of a contract, entred into with the Devil, some wonders are wrought, which pass the common understanding of men. Lib. 1. cap. 2. de Mag. Disq.
