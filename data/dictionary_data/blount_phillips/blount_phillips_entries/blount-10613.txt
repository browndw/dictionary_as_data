Titha cent (decimae) seems to be an abreviate of tithing, being the Saxon (a cent ota cent ua cent g) a little altered, which signifies decuriam, a tithing. It signifies the tenth part of all fruits predial or personal, &c. See Sir Henry Spelman, de non temerandis Ecclesiis, and Mr. Seldens History of Tithes.
