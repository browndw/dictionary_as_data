Metellus, a famous Roman Captain, who being to go by Sea, with a great Army against the Carthaginians and Sicilians, prayed to all the gods but Vesta, who being thereby offended, kept back the Navy with contrary windes, which Caius Julius the Priest affirmed could not be diverted, but by the sacrificing of his daughter Metella, which he yielding unto, the goddesse took compassion of the Virgin, and sent a Heifer in her stead, also the name of a High-Priest of the Romans, who when the Temple of Vesta was on fire, running into the Palladium out of the flame, he lost his sight by venturing too far into the fire.
