Gehenna, Properly signifies a place in a valley, in the Tribe of Benjamin, terrible for two sorts of fires in it; that wherein the Israelites sacrificed their children to the Idol Moloch; Secondly for another fire there continually burning, to consume the dead carcasses and filth of Jerusalem; Hence it was a type of Hell fire, and more usually taken for hell it self. David Kimchi, Psal. 27.13.
