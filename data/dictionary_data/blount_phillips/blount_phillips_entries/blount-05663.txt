Iohn (Hebr.) gracious, Thought to be an unfortunate name for Kings; For that John King of England well near lost his Kingdom, and John King of France was long Captive in England, and John Baliol was lifted out of his Kingdom of Scotland. And John Stewart, when the Kingdom of Scotland came to him, him, renouncing that name, would be proclaimed King Robert. Iuon is used by the Welch, and Sclavonians for John, and in this Realm about the Conquerors time, John was rarely found, but Iuon, as Cambden observes.
