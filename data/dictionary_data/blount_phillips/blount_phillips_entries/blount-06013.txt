Libertinism, Libertinage, or Libertinity (libertinitas) the state of him that of Bond is made free; Licentiousness, Epicurism. In Divinity it is thus defined. Libertinism is nothing else but a false liberty of belief and manners, which will have no other dependence but on peculiar fancy and passion. It is a strange monster, whereof it seems Job made description under the figure of Behemoth; as much to say, as a creature composed of all sorts of beasts, of which it bears the name, Iob 40. Causs. in his Maxims.
