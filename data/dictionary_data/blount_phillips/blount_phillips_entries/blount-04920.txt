Homage (Fr Hommage, i. fides clientularis) service, fidelity. In Court Barons, the Jury sworn to enquire of matters, is so called. It signifies also a servile ceremony of duty by some Tenants to their Lords, after this manner. The Tenant that holds Lands by Homage, kneeling on both knees before the Lord (who sits and holds the Tenants hands between his) saith as follows, I become your man from this day forth for life, for member and for worldly honor, and shall owe you my faith, for the Land I hold of you; saving the faith I owe to our Soveraign Lord the King, and to my other Lords.
