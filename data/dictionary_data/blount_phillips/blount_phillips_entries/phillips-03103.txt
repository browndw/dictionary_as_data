Coventry, a famous City in Warwickshire, so called from a Covent of Monks that was anciently there. The first Lord of this City is said to be one Leofric, who imposing heavy taxes upon the Citizens, remitted them at last at the earnest intercession of his wife Godiva, upon condition she would ride naked thorough the chief street of the City, which she performed, but so covered with her long hair, that no body could discern her.
