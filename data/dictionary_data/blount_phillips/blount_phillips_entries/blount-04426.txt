Gage (Fr.) a pawn or pledge. In our Law, use hath turned the G into W, as to Wage deliverance (Gager deliverance) to give security that a thing shall be delivered. Sea men Gage their Gask, that they may know the bigness of it, or how much is leaked out, which is done by putting down a stick at the Boong, and that by the wetness will shew how much liquor is in it. Also when they would know how much water a Ship draws when she is afloat, they stick a nail into a pike or pole, and put it down by the Rudder, till it catch hold under the Rudder; & this they call Gaging a ship.
