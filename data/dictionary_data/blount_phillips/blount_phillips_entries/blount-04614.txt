Gospel (from the Saxon Godspel) is compounded of God and Spel, the word God among the Saxons signifying good, as well as God, and no difference being discernable in the writing of these two words among them; unless, when tis taken for God, it has an (e) after it. (Spel) seems to signifie (word or mystical speech) among the Saxons, as when Bigspel (Deut. 28.37.) signifies a by-word or Proverb, or (as it is used in the North) By-spel. Some remains of the use of this word are still among us, as when a Charm, carmen,a in non-Latin alphabet a, indifferently a verse or word, one or more lines of Scripture or otherwise, either spoken or written, and hung about ones neck, on design to drive away a disease (according to the superstitious beleef and practice of some of our Ancestors) is still called a Spel, from the antient use of it, as in Propertius,(Sunt verba & voces, quibus hunc lenire dolorem Possisa)
