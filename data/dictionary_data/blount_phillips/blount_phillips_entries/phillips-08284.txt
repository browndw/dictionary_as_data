Northallerton, or Northalverton, the chief Town of Northallertonshire, being a part of York-shire, anciently so called, near this Town was fought that famous pitcht field, commonly called the battail of the Standard, where Ralph Bishop of Durham overthrew David King of Scots, it was so called because the English receiving the first onset of the Scots, kept themselves close together about the Standard, which resembled the Caroccio, so much used by the Italians.
