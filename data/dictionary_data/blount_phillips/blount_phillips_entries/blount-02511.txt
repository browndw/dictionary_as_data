Coverture, is a French word, and signifies any thing that covers, as Apparrel, a Coverlet, &c. In our Common Law, it is particularly applied to the estate and condition of a married woman, who by the Laws of the Realm is in potestate viri, under coverture or Covert baron, and therefore disabled to make any bargain or contract, without her husbands consent or privity, or without his allowance or confirmation.
