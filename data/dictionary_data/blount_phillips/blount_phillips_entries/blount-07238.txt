Onyx (Gr.) a precious stone found in the mountains of Arabia of the colour of a mans nail. Some write, that it is congealed of a juyce dropping from a tree called Onycha, which is the cause it smels sweet being cast into the fire; also that it is often found with divers pictures in it, being easily therein fashioned, before the stone be throughly hardned. This stone is called by some the Chalcidonie.
