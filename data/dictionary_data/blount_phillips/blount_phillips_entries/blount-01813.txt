Charter (Fr. Chartes, i. instrumenta.) It is taken in our common Law for written evidence of things done between man and man, which Briton in his 39 chapter divides into Charters of the King, and Charters of private persons. Charters of the King are those whereby the King passeth any Grant to any person or more, or to any body politique, as a Charter of exemption that a man shall not be empanelled upon any Jury, &c. Cowel.
