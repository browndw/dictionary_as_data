Levites (Levitae, ex filiis Levi) those of the Tribe of Levi in the old Law, which Tribe was particularly allotted for the Church, and whose maintenance was from the Tenths, First-fruits, Offerings, and Sacrifices of the people; Josh. 18.17. The Priesthood of the Lord was their inheritance. There were of them four kinds. First, Punies, or Tirones, who from their childhood to the five and twentieth year of their age, learned the duties of their Offices. Secondly, Graduates, who having spent four years in the study of the Law, were able to answer and oppose in it. Thirdly, Licentiates, who did actually exercise the Priestly function. And fourthly, Doctors (Rabbins they used to call them) who were the highest in degree.
