Emberweek, in Latin Cineralia, the week before Lent, wherein by the ancient institution of the Church people were to fast, and the Bishop used to sprinkle ashes upon their heads; saying, Remember, O man, that thou art ashes, and to ashes shalt thou return. Imber, signifying in the Saxon tongue ashes, whence our word embers cometh, some say ember week, is derived from the Greek word Hemerai, i. dayes.
