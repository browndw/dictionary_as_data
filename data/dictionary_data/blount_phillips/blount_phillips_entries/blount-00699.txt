Appian Way (Appia via) a notable street or High-way which leads from Rome to Capua in Campania, which Appius Claudius, in his Consulship, paved with stones and walled, and therefore took denomination from him; but was extended to Brundusium in Calabria, by Julius Caesar and Trajan. Of all others it seems to be the principal, by the testimony of Papinias the Poet, Appia cunctarum fertur Regina viarum.
