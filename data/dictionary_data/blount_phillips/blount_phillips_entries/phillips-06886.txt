Knights of the Temple, or Knights Templars, an Order of Knighthood erected by Pope Gelasius, about the year of our Lord 1117. these Knights in the beginning dwelling not far from the Sepulchre of Christ, intertained Christian strangers and Pilgrims charitably, and in their Armour led them through the holy land, to view such things as there were to be seen, and to defend them from the Infidels, but because at the last they abounded in many Vices, and many of them fell away from Christianity to the Saracens, the whole Order was suppressed by Pope Clement the fifth, and their substance given to the Knights of Rhodes, and other Religious Orders.
