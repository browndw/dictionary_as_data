Cinque Ports (Fr.) five Ports or Havens which lie towards France in the East of England, (viz.) Hastings, Dover, Hithe, Rumney, and Sandwich; for Rye and Winchelsea are but limbs or members belonging to Hastings, as likewise Lid and old Rumney, are Limbs of the Port of new Rumney, and not distinct Ports by themselves. The Inhabitants of these Cinque Ports and of their members, enjoy divers priviledges above the rest of the Commons of that Country. They pay no Subsidies; Suits at Law are commenced and answered within their own Liberties; their Majors have the credit of carrying the Canopy over the King or Queen at their Coronation. And for their greater dignity, they are placed then at a Table on the right hand of the King. Min. See the first institution of these Cinque Ports, and of the Lord Warden, in Camdens Brit. fol. 230.
