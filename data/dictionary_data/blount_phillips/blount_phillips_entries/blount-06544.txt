Metaphysicks (metaphysica, A a in non-Latin alphabet a, post vel trans, &a in non-Latin alphabet a: quasi trans-physica, quod rerum physicarum cognitionem transcendunt) a Science which lifting it self above the changeable nature of things, considers of such as subsist in their own essence, not subject to any alteration, dealing onely with Universals, abstracting from Individuals; School Divinity is the highest part of it, consisting chiefly in contemplative knowledge of God, Angels, souls of men, &c. Physick (says my Lord Bacon) is that which enquires of the efficient cause, and of the matter; Metaphysick, that which enquires of the form and end. Advanc. of Learn. fol. 143.
