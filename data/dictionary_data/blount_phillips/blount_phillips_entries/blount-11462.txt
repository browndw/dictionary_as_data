Watling-street, is one of the four ways, which the Romans are said to have made here in England, and called them, Consulares, Praetorias, Militares, Publicas. This Street is otherwise called Weriam-street, and leads from Dover, to London, Dunstable, and so to Westchester. An. 39 Eliz. cap. 2. The second Street is called Ikenild-street, beginning Ab Iconis, who were the people inhabiting Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire as Mr. Camden declares in his Brittan. pag. 345. The third is called Fosse, the reason of the name he giveth, because he thinks it was ditched of each side. The fourth is called Ermyn-street, &c. Of these read more in the said Author, pag. 43, 44. And in the first Volume of Holinsheds Chronicle, cap. 19.
