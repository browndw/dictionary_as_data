Paphus, the son of Pygmalion, the son of Cilix and Eburnea, for Pygmalion being an excellent graver, came into the Island of Cyprus, made the statue of a woman so admirable, that he fell in love with it, and prayed to Venus that he might have a wife as like as might be, to the statue he had made, which prayer was granted, and he coming home one time found the statue enlivened, with whom having lain he begat Paphus, who became King of Cyprus, and built a Citie which he called by his own name, and dedicated it to Venus, who was thence called the Paphian Queen.
