Wakes or Country Feasts, were most usually kept on the Sunday next after that Saints day, to whom the Parish Church was dedicated. And these Feasts took Origin from a Letter written by Gregory the Great to Melitus Abbot, sent into England with St Austin, in these words. It may therefore be permitted them (the English) that in the dedication days, or other solemn days of Martyrs, they make them Bowers about the Churches, and Feasting together, after a good religious sort, kill their Oxen now to the refreshing of themselves, to the praise of God, and encrease of Charity, which before they were wont to offer up in Sacrifice to the Devil, &c. Bede Eccles. Hist. c. 30. And they may be called Wakes, because on the Vigil of those Feasts, people were wont to watch and pray, or to awake from sleep at the several Vigils of the night; but now that Religious custom is prophanely converted into rude Sports, and Gluttonous Feasting for the most part.
