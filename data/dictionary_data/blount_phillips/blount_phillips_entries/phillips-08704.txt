Palm-tree, (lat.) a certain tree bearing the fruit called Dates, it is reported to be both male and female, the male bearing blossomes onely, the female both blossoms and fruit. The leaves shoot upward though oppressed with never so much weight. Whence the Palm is metaphorically used for Victory, Praise, and Commendations. Cleop.
