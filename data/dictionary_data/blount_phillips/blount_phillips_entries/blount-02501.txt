Cosmography (cosmographia) the description of the world in general. This Art, by the distance of the Circles in Heaven, divides the Earth under them into her Zones and Climats, and by the elevation of the Pole, considers the length of the day and night, with the perfect demonstration of the Suns rising and going down, &c. And is best handled by Pliny in his Natural History.
