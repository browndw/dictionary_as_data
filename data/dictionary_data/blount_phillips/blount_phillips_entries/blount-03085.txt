Directory (from the Lat. Dirigo) is the name of a book introduced by the late long Parliament in the stead of the Common Prayer Book, which was voted down on the 26 of November, 1644. and is called a Directory, because it directs the Ministers and people in a different way of praying, preaching, and administring the Sacraments.
