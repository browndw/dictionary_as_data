Marleborough, a Town in Wiltshire, seated upon the River Cunetio or Kenet, so called from Marga or Marle, because it standeth upon a chalky ground. Alexander Necham calleth it Merlebrigia, from the Tomb of Merlin the Prophet; this Town is famous for a Parliament in old times, assembled here, who made a Law for appeasing tumults, called the Statute of Marleba cent row.
