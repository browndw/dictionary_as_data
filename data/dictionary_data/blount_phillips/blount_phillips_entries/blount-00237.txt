Affray (from the Fr. Affres, i. a fright) may be without word or blow given, as if a man shew himself furnished with Armor or Weapons not usually worn, it may strike a fear into others unarmed. For which reason it is a common wrong, and inquireable in a Leet; which makes it differ from Assault, which is always a particular injury. 4 H. 6, 10.8 Ed. 4, 5.
