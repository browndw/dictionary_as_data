Were-wulf or Were-wolf (were in the old Sax. was sometimes used for man) this name remains still known in the Teutonick, and is as much as Man-wolf; which is a certain Sorcerer, who having anointed his body with an Ointment made by instinct of the Devil, and putting on a certain inchanted Girdle, does not only to the view of others, seem as a VVolf, but to his own thinking, hath both the shape and nature of a VVolf, so long as he wears the said Girdle, and accordingly worries and kills humane creatures. Of these sundry have been taken in Germany, and the Neatherlands. One Peter Stump, for being a Were-wolf, and having killed thirteen children, two women, and one man, was at Bedhur, not far from Cullen, in the year 1589. put to a very terrible death. Verst.
