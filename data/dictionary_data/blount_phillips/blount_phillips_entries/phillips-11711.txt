Tunicle, (lat) a little coat; also a membrane or thin skin, covering any part of the body: there are four especially which cover the eye, the Corneal or Horny, the Uveal, the Vitreal or glassy, and the Christalline, and to each of these there are foure humours answerable. And four that cover the cods, the Scrotum, the Erythroides, the Epididymis, and one other which is called Dartos.
