A Is the first Letter among the Greekes, which they call Alpha, from the first of the Hebrews, Aleph: It is sometimes used in numbers, as Alpha the first, Beta the second, Gamma the third. In the Greek composition it has a divers use; but the privative is most to our purpose; for being set before a simple word, it deprives or takes away its proper signification.
