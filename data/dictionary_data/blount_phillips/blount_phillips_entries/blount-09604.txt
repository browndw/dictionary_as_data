Sicle or Shekel (siclus, from the Hebrew shakel, i. librare) as well a kind of coyn both of Silver and Gold, as a weight among the Jews; on one side of the silver Shekel was carved a pot with Manna, and this Inscription in Hebrew, The Shekel of Israel; on the other, Aarons Rod, with this, Holy Jerusalem; this (which was called the Holy Shekel) was worth of our money about two shillings six pence; the common Shekel half so much, in weight half an ounce, Exod. 30.13. Gen. 23 15, 16. And from thence comes our word Skale, to weigh with; see Moses and Aaron, p. 265.
