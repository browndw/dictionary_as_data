Latitat (the third person of latito, to lye hid) is the name of a Writ, whereby all men in personal actions are called originally to the Upper Bench. Fitz. nat. br. fol. 78. M. And it hath the name from this, because in respect of their better expedition, a man is supposed to lurk, so as not to be found upon a former Writ; and therefore being served with this Writ, he must put in security for his appearance at the day; for Latitare, est se malitiose occultare animo fraudandi creditores suos agere volentes. L. Fulcinius.
