Q. Mutius, a stout Roman, who in the war with Porsenna King of the Hetrurians went into the enemies Camp with an intent to have killed the King; but being taken and threatned with extraordinary punishments, he thrust his right hand into the fire and burnt it off, to shew his contempt of torments; whence he was called Scaevola, and telling Porsenna, that 300 youths had in like manner conspired against him, he was so terrified that immediately he made a peace with the Romans.
