Reioynder (from the Fr. Rejoindre, i. to rejoyn, or joyn again) signifies in our Common Law, as much as Duplication with the Civilians, that is, an Exception or Answer to a Replication: For first, the Plaintiff exhibites his Bill, the Defendant answers, then the Plaintiff replies to that Answer, which is called a Replication, to which the Defendant rejoyns, which is called a Rejoynder, especially in Chancery-Westm. part. 2. Symb. Tit. Chancery. Sect. 56.
