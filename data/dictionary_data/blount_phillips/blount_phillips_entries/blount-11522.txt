Sir Thomas Smith in his Repub. Angl. lib. 1. cap. 23. calls him a Yoman, whom our Laws call Legalem hominem, which (says he) is in English a Freeman born, that may dispend of his own Free-land, in yearly revenue, to the value of forty shillings Sterling; The former Etymology of the name he likes not, making question, whether it comes of the Dutch (Yoncker) or not, which in the Low-Countries signifies a mean Gentleman, or a Gay-fellow; but he that hath added the Marginal Notes to that Book, seems to draw it from the Saxon (Geman) which signifies a married man.
