Mountain of Piety (mons pietatis) is a stock of money raised by the charity of good people, who, observing the poor ruined by the usury of Jews, voluntarily contributed good store of treasure to be preserved and lent to them, whereby they, upon security, might have money at a low rate to relievea their wants; which, because the mass is great and the thing pious and charitable in it self, is called a Mountain of Piety; But in respect the Officers and incident charges cannot be had without some emolument, therefore the borrower payes somewhat by the moneth for the loan of that he receives. Cajet. opusc. de monte Pietat. c. 1.
