Oxford, the chief City of Oxfordshire, which some say hath been anciently called Caer Vortigern, and Caer Vember, as being thought to have been built by Vortigern and Memprix; but the Saxons called it Oxenford (corresponding to Bosphorus among the Greeks) from a foard of Oxen. Leland deriveth it from the River Ouse, and supposeth it may have formerly been called Ouseford. It is chiefly famous for its University which Cambden calleth, Our most noble Athens, the Muses seat, the Sun, the Eye, and the Soul of England. This University was begun, as most Authors agree, in the year of our Lord 806. three Colledges being built by the learned Aelfred who then reigned.
