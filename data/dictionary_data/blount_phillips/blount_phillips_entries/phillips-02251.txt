Ceremonies, rites of the Church, from the ancient Latin word Cerus, which signifieth holy, or else from the Caerites, a people of Hetruria, who chearfully entertained all the sacred things of the Romans, which were brought to them by the Vestals when Rome was taken by the Gaules: whereupon the Romans out of gratitude, ordered that all things belonging to Religious Worship, should be called Ceremonies.
