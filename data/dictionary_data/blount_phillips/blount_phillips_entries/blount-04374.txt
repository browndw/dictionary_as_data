Fugalia (Lat.) a Feast aunually solemnized by the old Romans in remembrance of the expulsion of the Kings out of Rome. According to which pattern, the joyful English having cleared the Country of the Danes, instituted the annual sports of Hock tide, the word (in old Saxon) importing the time of scorning or triumphing. This Solemnity consisted in the merry meetings of the neighbors on those days, during which the Festival lasted, and was celebrated by the younger sort of both Sexes, with all manner of Exercises and Pastimes in the streets, as Shrovetide yet is. But now time hath so corrupted it, that (the name excepted) there remains no sign of the first institution. Heyl. Verstegan thinks this Hock-tide may come from the Teutonick, Heugh-tide, i. A time of gladness or joy.
