Portgreve (compounded of Port and greve or grave, i. perfectus) signifies with us the chief Magistrate in certain Port Towns. And (as Cam. saith in his Britan. p. 325,) the chief Magistrate of London was termed by this name; instead of whom, Richard the first ordained two Bayliffs; but presently after King John granted them a Major for their yearly Magistrate.
