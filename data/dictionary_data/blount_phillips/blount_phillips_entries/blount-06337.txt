Marchasite or Marquesite (marchasita) a stone participating with the nature of some mettal, yet in so small quantity, that the mettal cannot be melted from it, but will vapor away in smoak, the stone turning to ashes; those Marchasites are commonly in colour like the metal mixed with them, whether it be Gold, Silver, Brass, or any other. Some affirm a Marchasite to be any stone out of which fire may be strucken.
