Lourdane or Lordane (Fr. Lourdin) sottish, dunce-like, heavy, dull, blockish. But Sir R. Baker in his Chron. fo. 18. gives this etymology; when the Danes Lorded it in England, the English were fain to till and ear the ground, whilst the Danes sate idle, and ate the fruit of their labors, and yet in every place, for very fear, were called Lord-Danes, which afterwards became a word of derision, when one would signifie a Lazy-Lubber.
