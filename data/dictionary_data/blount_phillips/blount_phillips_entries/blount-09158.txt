Sadduces, a Sect among the Jews, who dis-beleeved the being of Angels or Spirits, the Resurrection of the body, and Holy Ghost; they received onely the Pentateuch, and in many other things agreed with the Samaritans, &c. The derivation of their name is variously delivered by Authors; some take it from Sadoc, who is said to have lived about the time of Alexander the Great, and to be Author of this Sect; Others, from Tsedech or Zaddichim, both which signifie Justice; others deduce the name from Sedah a Chaldean word, signifying to part or divide; see Moses and Aaron. p. 46.
