Titus Manlius Torquatus, the son of Manlius, surnamed the Imperious, he overcame the Gaul that challenged the stoutest of the Romans to fight with him, and took off his Golden Chain, whence Torquatus became a name to him and all his family, he caused his sonne to be beheaded for fighting against his command; notwithstanding he had obtained the victory, whence Manlian severity became a proverb.
