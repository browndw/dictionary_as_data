Days (according to the division of Authors) are either Astronomical or Political: of Astronomical, some are natural, and some again Artificial. An Artificial day consists of twelve hours, Joh. 11.19. There be twelve hours in the day. Gen. 1.4, 5. & 47-9. A Natural day consists of twenty four hours. The beginning of Politique days, is divers: for the Athenians began their day from Sun-set; but the Iews, Chaldeans, and Babylonians from Sun-rise; the Egyptians and the Romans from midnight, of whom we take our pattern to count the hours from midnight, one, two, three, &c. The AEmbrians from noon. The parts of Politique or Civil days (according to Macrobius) are these. The first time of day is after midnight. The second, in Lat. Gallicinium, Cocks-crow. The third Conticinium, the space between the first Cock and break of day. The fourth Diluculum, the break or dawn of the day. The fifth Mane the morning. The sixth Meridies, noon or mid-day. The seventh Pomeridies, the afternoon. The eighth Serum diei, Sun-set. The ninth, suprema tempestas, twylight. The tenth, Vesper, the evening or eventide. The eleventh, prima fax, candle-time The twelfth, nox concubia, bed time. The thirteenth Nox intempesta, the dead time of the night. Vide Agellium, Macrobium, & Fungerum.
