Mastick (mastiche) a white and clear gum, of a sweet savour, and grows on the Lentisk tree in the Island Chios. It's temperate in heat, and of a dry binding nature, wherefore it strengthens the stomack, stays vomiting, and stops any issue of blood. Some use to rub their teeth with it, as well to whiten them, as to fasten such as are loose.
