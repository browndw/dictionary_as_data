Saxons (the ancient name of our Ancestors in England) were so called from their use, and wearing a certain Sword or Weapon, made after the fashion of a Sithe, which in the Neatherlands is called a Saisen. These kind of Swords were anciently written Seaxen or Seaxes; and the Welshmen wrote them Saisons, as they yet write us. The learned Engelhusus, of this weapon Seaxe, and name Saxon, hath this Latin Rime.
