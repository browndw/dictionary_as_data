Tydeus, the son of Oeneus King of Caledonia, he having slain his brother Menalippus, fled to Adrastus, whose daughter Delphile he married; afterwards being sent by Polynices to his brother Eteocles, King of Thebes, he overcame all his guests at several Combats; whereupon at his return they set 50 young men to lie in wait for him under the command of Maeon the son of Aemon, and Lycophon the son of Autophonus, who were all slain by him except Maeon, whom he sent back to carry news of the others deaths: at length he was mortally wounded by one Menalippus a Theban.
