Hause (Fr.) a Company, Society or Corporation of Merchants (for so it signifies in the Book of the Ordonnances of Paris) combined together for the good usage, and safe passage of Merchandize from Kingdom to Kingdom. This Society was, and in part yet is indued with many large priviledges of Princes, respectively within their Territories. It had four principal seats or Staples; where the Almain or Dutch Merchants, being the erectors of it, had an especial house, one of which was here in London, called Gildhalda Teutonicorum, or in our common language the Steelyard. But in Germany we read of seventy two Hanse Towns, as Lubeck, Hambourg, Magdenbourg, &c. See more of this in Ortelius in the Index of his additament to his Theater, verbo Anciatici.
