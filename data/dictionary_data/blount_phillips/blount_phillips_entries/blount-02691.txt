St. Davids day, The first of March kept solemnly by the Britans in honor of their Patron St. David, whom their Records and Tradition testifie to have been a person of eminent sanctity and austerity of life, excellently learned; a most eloquent preacher of Gods word, and Archbishop of Menevy, now from him called St. Davids in Pembrook-shire. He flourished in the fifth and sixth age after the coming of Christ, and dyed in the 140 year of his own, as Dr. Pits witnesseth in de illustribus Britanniae Scriptoribus. The Brittans always wear a Leek on that day in memory of a famous victory obtained by them against the Saxons; the said Britains for the time of the battel, wearing Leeks in their hats for their military colours by St. Davids perswasion.
