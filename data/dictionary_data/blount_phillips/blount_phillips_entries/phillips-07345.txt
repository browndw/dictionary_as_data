Lucretia, the daughter of Lucretius Tricipitinus Prefect of Rome, and the wife of Tarquinius Collatinus, she being ravisht by Sextus the son of Tarquinius Superbus King of the Romans, slew her self, which was the cause of banishing both Tarquin and Kingly Government from Rome which was afterwards ruled by Consuls chosen anew every year, and this act of Lucretia hath ever since been so famed, that every chast woman is proverbially called a Lucrece.
