Jarre of Oile, an earthen pitcher, containing twenty Gallons, also the Order of Knights of the Jarre, was instituted by Don Garcia, King of Navarre, who riding one day on hunting, and entring into a Cave, he saw an Altar with the image of the Virgin Marie, and a Pitcher of Lillies, at which sight being moved with devotion, he founded this order.
