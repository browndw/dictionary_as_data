Cephalus, the son of Eion, he married Procris, the daughter of Erichtheus King of Athens, and being loved of Aurora, would not answer her love: one morning after he had been a hunting with a dart which Procris gave him, and a dog called Lelaps, he sate down and called upon Aura to refresh him; but his wife having followed him out of jealousie, had hid her self in a bush. Cephalus perceiving the bush to move, thought it had been a wild beast, and shot his wife, and afterwards was turned into a stone.
