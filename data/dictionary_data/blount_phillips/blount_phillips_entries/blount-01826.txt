Cherub Cherubin (Heb. i.e. fulness of knowledge) the second of the nine Quires or Ranks of Angels mentioned in Scripture, so called of their sublime knowledge or illuminated understanding. In Scripture God is said to sit on the Cherubins; because he over-reaches and is above all understanding. They also are said to bear and draw his Chariot: to signifie all his proceedings to ba cent according to wisdom; and to be full of eyes, to certifie Gods knowledge to penetrate into all secresies, and all to be open before him. They are set forth only with heads and wings, without bodies: whereby is notified, that greatest understanding is found in spiritual and incorporeal creatures, and that over-great corporal cares are impediments to profound knowledge. Tr. of Mass.
