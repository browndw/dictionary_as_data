Lemnos, an Island in the Aegean Sea, famous for the fall of Vulcan, who by reason of his deformity, being thrown down from heaven, as soon as he was born, hapned to light in this place, whence he was called the Lemnian God, this Island was originally known by the name of Hipsipylaea, from a daughter of Thoas of that name, who was Queen thereof.
