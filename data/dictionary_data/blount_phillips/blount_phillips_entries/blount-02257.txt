Conders (from the Latin conducere, i. to conduct or lead) are such as stand on high places near the Sea-coast, at the time of Herring-fishing, to make signs with Boughs, or such like in their hands, to the Fishers, which way the Shole of Herrings passeth; For that may better appear to such as stand on some high Cliff on the shore, by a kinde of blew colour, that the said Shole makes in the water, then to those in the ship: These are otherwise called Huers and Balcors, as appears by the Statute. Anno 1. Jac. cap. 22.
