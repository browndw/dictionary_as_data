Halcyon (Gr.) a kind of small Bird called by some a Kings-fisher, and breeding on the Sea-shoar about the winter solstice, which time, being about fourteen days, there is no tempest or storm. Hence tis we call peaceable or quiet times, Halcycon or Halcyonian days. Two notable properties are observed in the Nest of this Bird, which she makes with the foam of the Sea; The first is, That the Architecture of it is so strong, so durable, that it cannot be broken, nor cut, even with the violent stroak of iron. The second, That it is so proportioned to the Bird, as if it were sewed to her body, in such manner as no creature can therein be received, but the Architect himself. Caussinus. See more in Vul. Err. p. 128. and 129.
