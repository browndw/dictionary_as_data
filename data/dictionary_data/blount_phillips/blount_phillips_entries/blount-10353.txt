Tantalize, Poets feign Tantalus, King of Phrygia, to have been the son of Jupiter, and the Nymph Plota, and that he received the gods to a banquet, and sod his own son Pelops, and gave them him to eat; Ceres only did eat of the shoulder, the rest forbearing that meat, yet Pelops was restored to life and received an ivory shoulder for his own; and for that Tantalus discovered the secrets of the gods to men; therefore is he said to be tormented in hell thus; He stands up to the chin in a pleasant River, and a tree of fair fruit hanging over him, and yet is he always plagued with hunger and thirst, for when he either stoops down to drink, or reaches out his hand to take an apple, they both so retire that he cannot touch the one or taste the other, therefore he may be called Tantalus, quasia in non-Latin alphabet a, i. infelicissimus. Hence to be tantalized, is to be in the condition of Tantalus, to be near unto, or in sight of some happiness or wished thing, and yet not to be permitted to enjoy it.
