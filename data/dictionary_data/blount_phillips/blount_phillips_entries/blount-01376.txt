Breviary (breviarium) an abridgement, or compendious draught, a short collection. Particularly, it is the name of a Book, to the daily recital whereof Catholick Priests are tied, from the time they take the order of Sub-Deaconship, in discharge of part of their Function. I have heard that the late Lord Treasurer Cecil, after he had diligently perused this Book, did greatly admire the order and method of it, saying it might well be termed a Breviary, for containing so much, and such variety in so contracted a bulk.
