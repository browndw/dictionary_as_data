Harpyes (harpyae) monstrous and ravenous birds, which Poets feign to have had womens faces, hands armed with Talons, and Bellies full of ordure, wherewith they infected all meat they touched; They lived in Stymphalis a lake of Arcadia, and were named Aello, Ocypete, Celeno, and Thyella. Thus the Poet.
