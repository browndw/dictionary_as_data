Sanhedrim or Sanhedrin, (Hebr.) Synedrion or Synedrium (Gr.) signifies generally the place where Counsellors meet to consult of, and determine matters; also the Assembly it self; But, by an appropriation of the word, it is commonly taken for the highest Court of Judicature, or supreme Council of the Jews, which consisted of the High Priest, and seventy Seniors or Elders; from which number it was called by them in Hebrew words, signifying, Domus judicii septuaginta unius, i. a Court of seventy and one Judges; and it was (as it were) their Parliament, to consult about, to judge and decide the greatest matters that could arise in their Ecclesiastical or Civil Commonwealth; as, to determine the Controversies that might happen concerning their High Priest, true and false Prophets, differences betwixt Nation and Nation, Tribe and Tribe, &c. This High Court was first (by the commandment of God) instituted in the Wilderness by Moses, whilst under his conduct, the children of Israel were on their journey out of Egypt, towards the Land of Promise; and afterwards it continued still in vigor till our Saviors Passion.
