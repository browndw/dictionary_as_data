June, the fourth moneth of the year from March the first. Some say it was so called from Juno, as it were junonian moneth. Others from Junius Brutus, who begun his Consulship in that moneth: it is called in Greek Hecatombaeon, from the Hecatombs or Sacrifices of a hundred Oxen which used to be offered to Jupiter in this moneth.
