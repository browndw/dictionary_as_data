Heroick Poem, so called, for that it treats of the manners of Heroes or heroick persons, not natural Causes; manners presented, not dictated, and manners fained (as the name of Poesie imports) not found in men. The part of an heroick Poem is to exhibite a venerable and amiable Image of heroick vertue. Mr. Hobbs. See Poesie.
