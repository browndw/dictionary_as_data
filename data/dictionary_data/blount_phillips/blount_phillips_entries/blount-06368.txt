In Francis the firsts time there were but two Lord Marshals of France, now there are ten, who having their several Provinces assigned them by the King, ride Circuits, are present at all general musters, to see how military Discipline is observed in Garisons, view the Fortifications and reparations of Frontier Towns, the munition and victual of Arsenals and Store-houses, and lastly, provide for the punishment and suppression of all vagrant and idle Rogues; And as they (under the Constable) command all Dukes, Earls, Barons, Captains and Gensdarms; so may they neither give battle, make Proclamation, nor muster any men, without his commandment.
