Phoenix (Lat.) the rarest bird in the world, and is commonly described thus; There was never any but one of this kind living at once; and that onely in Arabia, of the bigness of an Eagle, of a purple colour, having a bright coller of gold about his neck, a goodly fair tail, and a tuft of feathers upon his head; he liveth above 600 years, and being old builds him a nest of Cinnamon, and the twigs of Frankincense, which he fills with spices, and then with the laboring of his wings in the Sun, setting it on fire, is there consumed; out of whose ashes there grows a worm, and of the worm another Phoenix; This, I say, is the common received opinion, as you may see in Tacitus, and other Authors; but Dr. Br. in his Vul. Err. makes question whether there be any such Animal in nature, whom you may read at large upon this subject; fol. 131.
