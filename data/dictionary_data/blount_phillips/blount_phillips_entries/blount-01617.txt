Carrat (Fr. carat) among Goldsmiths and Mintmen is the third part of an ounce; among Jewellers or Stonecutters, but the 192 part, for eight of them make but one sterlin, and a sterlin is the four and twentieth part of an ounce. Three grains of Assize or four grains of Diamond weight make a carrat. A fool of twenty five carrats, is an egregious fool, a fool beyond all proportion; the finest gold being but of four and twenty carrats, which is the essay, by which the fineness of the gold is known.
