Astrology (astrologia) is a Science which tells the Reasons of the Stars and Planets motions. Astrology (says Dr. Bullokar) doth promise by the motion and influence of Stars and Planets to foretel things to come; or (as my Lo. Bac. says) it professeth to discover the influence and domination of the superior Globe over the inferior; and therefore may be termed a kind of natural divination, so long as it keeps it self in due limits, and arrogates not too much to its certainty; into which excess if it once break forth, it can then be no longer called natural Divination, but superstitious and wicked; for the Stars may incline, but not impose a necessity in particular things.
