Nomenclator (Lat. Quasi nominis calator) he that knows the names of things, and calls them thereby; a common Crier in a Court of Justice; a Bedel, or like Officer, to whom it belongs to know by heart, the names, offices, and crafts of all the Citizens, thereby to instruct such as among the Romans did stand for any Office, that they might speak to them more gently. Thomasius.
