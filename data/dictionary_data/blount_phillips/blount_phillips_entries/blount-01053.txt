Auncient Demeasn, Demain or Domain. (1. publicum vectigal, or Vetus patrimonium Domini) signifies in our Common Law, a certain Tenure whereby all the Mannors belonging to the Crown in the days of St. Edward the Saxon King, or William the Conqueror, were held. The number and names of which Mannors as of all other belonging to common persons, he caused to be written into a book (after a survey made of them) now remaining in the Exchequer, and called Dooms-day Book, and those which by that Book appear to have belonged to the Crown at that time, and are contained under the title (Terra Regis) are called Auncient Demeasn.
