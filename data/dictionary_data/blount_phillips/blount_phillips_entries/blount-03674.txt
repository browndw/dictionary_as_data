Equinoctial (aequinoctium) is an imagined line pasa cent ng just in the midst between the two Poles of Heaven, to which line the Sun coming twice a year (namely, about the eleventh of March, and the eleventh of September) makes the days and nights of equal length in all the world (unless with such as inhabit just under the Poles;) for which cause it is called Aequinoctial: The Signs, Aries and Libra both begin at this time.
