Raca or Racha (from the Hebr. Rach, i. to spit; or from Ric, i. lightheaded or empty) an imperfect or broken speech proceeding from an angry minde; a word of reproach, signifying as much as a vain or empty fellow. Matth. 5.23. Hence perhaps that opprobrious word of ours, a Rachil, or Rake-hel, i. such a one as if one should rake hell, his like would not be sound.
