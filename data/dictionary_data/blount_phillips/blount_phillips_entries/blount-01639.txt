Cata-baptist (Gr.) one that abuseth or depraves, or is an adversary to the Sacrament of Baptism. A Catabaptist may sometimes be no Anabaptist, such was Leo Capronymus, who defiled the Font at his Baptism, yet was not Christened again, but every Anabaptist is necessarily a Cataptist, for the iteration of that Sacrament is an abuse and pollution of it. Dippers dipt.
