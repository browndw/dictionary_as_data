Emancipate (emancipo) to make free, to set at liberty, to affranchize, or sell his title to another. By the Roman Law every Son was in such subjection to his Father, that before he could be released of it and made free, he should by an imaginary sale, be sold three times by his natural Father, to another man, who was called by the Lawyers Pater Fiduciarius, a Father in trust; yea and be bought again by the natural Father, and so manumised by him, and then he became free. This imaginary sale was called Mancipatio; the children thus alienated from the Father, were termed Emancipati; this form of setting free was termed Emancipatio. Godwin.
