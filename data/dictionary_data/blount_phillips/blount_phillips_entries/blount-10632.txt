Tonange is a Custom or Impost due for Merchandize brought or carried in Tuns and such like vessels, from or to other Nations, after a certain rate in every Tun, 1. Jac. cap. 33. I have heard it also called a duty, due to the Mariners for the unloading their ship arrived in any Haven after a rate for every Tun.
