Carefox or Carfax, A Market-place in Oxford, so called; which may come of the French Quarrefour or carrefour, signifying any place or part of a Town, where four streets meet at a head; as at Carfox in Oxford, for there is the Quarre, the square and quadrant. Min. Or (according to Mr. Sumner) it may be a corruption from the French, quatre voyes. i. four ways.
