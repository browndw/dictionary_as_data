Winefred, if Saxon, signifies win or get peace; but some conceive it to be a Brittish word, corrupted from Gwen fremi. Frewi was the Saints name at first, but had the addition Gwen (which signifies white in the Feminine Gender) from the white circle that remained in her neck, after she was revived by Benno, the Priest, and Pastor of the Church (as the story goes) by joyning her cut off head, to her dead body. For it is a Tradition among the Britans, that in the very place where her head was cut off by wicked Cradacus, there sprung the Well that has to this day continued under the name of St Winefreds Well in Flintshire; esteemed to be the most plentiful and miraculous Spring in the world.
