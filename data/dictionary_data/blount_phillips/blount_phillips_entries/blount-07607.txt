Patavinity (patavinitas) the property of, or relation to, the City Padua. Livy was censured by Asinius for Patavinity in his writings, by which was meant that he had too much used the phrases or affectations of Padua, and neglected those of Rome; or (as others will have it) that the flourishing verdure, or overflowing of his stile was in some sort agreeable to the fertility and redundancy of the soyl of that City and Country.
