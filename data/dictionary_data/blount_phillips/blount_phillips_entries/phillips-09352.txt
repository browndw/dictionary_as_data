Pomfret, or Pontfract, a Town in Yorkshire, so called (for in the Saxons time it was named Ka cent rkby) from a wooden bridge over Are, broken by the confluence of a great multitude of people that accompanied William Arch-Bishop of York, King Stephens Nephew when he returned from Rome. This place hath been stained with the blood-shed of many Great men; here Thomas Earle of Lancaster was beheaded by King Edward the second; King Richard the second was here made away by the appointment of King Henry the fourth. Also Anthony Earle Rivers, and Sir Richard Grey, were here beheaded by King Richard the third.
