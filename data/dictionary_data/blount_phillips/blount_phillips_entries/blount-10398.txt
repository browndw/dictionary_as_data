Templaries, or Knights of the Temple (Templarii) certain religious Christian-souldiers dwelling about the Temple at Jerusalem, and therefore so called, whose office and vow was to defend that Temple and the holy Sepulchre, and to entertain Christian strangers that came thither for devotion, to guard them in safety, when they went to visit the places of the holy land: Their habit was a white cloak or upper garment with a red cross and a sword gira cent about them, as you may see in Mr. Dugdales Antiquities of Warwick-shire. This order was instituted by Pope Gelasius about the year of our Lord 1117. or 1120. and had flourished about two hundred years, when it was suppressed by Clement the fifth.
