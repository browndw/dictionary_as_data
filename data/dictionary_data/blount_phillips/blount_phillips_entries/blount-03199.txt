A Dock for ships (navale) there are two kinds of them, a dry Dock, which is made with Flood-gates, to keep out the Tide, in which ships are built and repaired, and wherein they sit without danger. A wet Dock, which is in any Creek or place, where a ship may be cast in out of the Tides way; and there when a ship has made her self (as it were) a place to lye in, we say she has Docked herself.
