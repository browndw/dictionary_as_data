Quintain or Quintin, a game or sport still in request at Marriages, in some parts of this Nation, specially in Shropshire; the manner now corruptly thus, a Quintin, Buttress or thick Plank of Wood is set fast in the ground in the Highway, where the Bride and Bridegroom are to pass; and Poles are provided, with which the young-men run a Tilt on Horse-back; and he that breaks most Poles, and shews most activity, wins the Garland. But Stow in his Survey of London, p. 76. says, That in Ann. 1253. the Youthful Citizens, for an exercise of their activity, set forth a game to run at the Quintin, and whosoever did best, should have a Peacock for prise, &c.
