Nominalia, A Feast among the Romans: to Females they gave the name on the eighth day, to Males on the ninth, which they called Dies lustricus, as it were the cleansing day, on which they solemnized this Feast; and (as Turtullian notes) Fata adscribenda advocabantur, that is (as I conceive) their Nativities were set. The Athenians gave names on the tenth day, others on the seventh.
