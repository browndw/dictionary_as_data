Cheverel-Leather. Minshew says it comes from the Fr. Chevreul. i. a wild Goat, of whose skin (saith he) it is made. But others hold it takes denomination from the River Charwel or Chervel, in Latin Cheruellus, running on the East side of Oxford, the water whereof is famous for tawing or dressing Leather; then which, no Leather in the world is more soft, white and delicate. Doctor Pit in his description of Oxford.
