Vrim and Thummim, a light of the knowledge of Christ, by the Word, together with perfection of vertue and holy manners; Exod. 28.30. Thou shalt put in the Brest-plate of Judgement, the AErim and Thummim. Who made this AErim and Thummim, what it was, and of what made, is very hard, if not impossible to finde out: Certainly, it was not reckoned among the things wrought by Art, but was given to God by Moses alone, to put in the holy Pectoral, as Levit. 8.8. and written of Christ, Colos. 2.3. Dan. 8.13. See Sir W. Ral. lib. 2. fol. 395.
