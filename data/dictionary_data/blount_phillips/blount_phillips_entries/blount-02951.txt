Devise (Fr.) is an invention or conceit in picture, with his Motto or Word, born as well by Noble and Learned Personages, as by Commanders in War, to notifie some particular conceit or design of their own. And is the same which the Italians (and we also from them) call an Imprese, wherein there is required a correspondency of the Picture, which is as the body; and the Motto, which (as the soul) gives it life; that is, the body must be of fair representation, and the Motto in some different language, witty, short and answerable thereto, neither too obscure, nor too plain, and most commended, when it is an Hemistich, or parcel of a verse; for example, one, who, as triumphing over the force of Venus, depainted her Son, winged Cupid, in a net, with this Motto. Qui capit, Capitur. Likewise the needle in the Sea Compass still moving, but to the North-point onely, with Move or immotus, notified the respective constancy of the bearer to one onely.
