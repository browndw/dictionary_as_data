Anti-Trinitarians, i. Adversaries to the blessed Trinity, who are more spoken of in Writers under the name of Trinitarians, which comprehends those Hereticks that reject the word Trinity, as not being found in Holy Scripture, and deny the number and distinction of Three persons in the blessed Trinity. As the Arians, who denied him to be truly God, whom true believers call the Son of the Eternal Father, or the second person of the Blessed Trinity. Or as the Sabellians (having their name from their Author Sabellius an Egyptian, who lived Anno Christi 260.) who denied any difference or distinction betwixt the Three persons, confounding the Three into One. Or as the Macedonians (so denominated from Macedonius a Bishop of Constantinople, living about the year of Christ 359.) who denied the Holy Ghost to be God, or, as many other old condemned Hereticks, to whose opinions subscribed those in the last age, who are termed Deists, followers of one Gregorius Pauli a Minister of Cracovia in Poland about the year of Christ 1564, who vented many blasphemies against the blessed Trinity; and divers others, as Ludovicus Herser, Michael Servetus, Campanus, with many of their Disciples in Germany, Hungary, Poland, and other places, where there are of them to this day.
