Orion, the name of a great hunter, who vaunting himself to be of that strength of body, that there was no wilde beast that he could not kill, the earth brought forth a Scorpion, which stinging him to death, he was placed together with the Scorpion among the heavenly constellations, some say he was the son of Oenopion King of Sicilie, and that lying with his sister Candiope, he had his eyes put out by his father, others deliver him to have been born by a very strange way, of which see more in Hyreus.
