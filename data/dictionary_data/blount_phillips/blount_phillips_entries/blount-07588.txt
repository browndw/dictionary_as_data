The Jewish Passover was a holy action ordained of God in the killing and eating a Lamb, partly to the end the Jewish Church might keep in memory the benefit which God did for them, in passing over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, and smiting them not, Exod. 12.11. Also to be a Type of Christ the true Paschal Lamb. See Moses and Aaron. p. 103.
