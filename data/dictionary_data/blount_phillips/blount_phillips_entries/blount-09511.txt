Septuagints (septuaginta) properly signifie the seventy Translators of the holy Bible out of Hebrew into Greek, who were in truth Seventy two (viz) six chosen out of every one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, by Eleazer the High-Priest, at the request of Prolomaeus Philadelphus King of Aegypt, for the richest ornament of his memorable Library. These by compendious speech are called the seventy Interpreters, as the Centum viri, among the Romans, who were indeed One hundred and five, three out of a Tribe, and thirty five Tribes. Budaeus.
