Sterling, is the old term or Epitheton for money currant in this Nation; which thus took denomination; In the time of Richard the First, money coined in the East paa cent t of Germany, began to be of special request in England for its purity, & was cal'd Easterling money, as the Inhabitants of those parts were called Easterlings; shortly after some of that Country, skilful in Mint-matters and Allayes, were sent for hither to bring our coyn to perfection, which since that time was called from them, sterling, for Easterling; Not from Sterling or Striveling in Scotland, nor from a star, or the bird Starling, which some dreamt to be stamped on it; For in old Deeds, they are always called Nummi Esterlingi; which implied as much as good and lawful money of England, or Proba Moneta, among the Civilians, and Monois de Roy in France. Cam. Rem. fol. 184.
