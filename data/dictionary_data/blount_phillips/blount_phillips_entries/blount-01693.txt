Caursines (otherwise called Lumbards) were Italians by birth, and came into England in the year 1235. terming themselves the Popes Merchants, driving no other trade then letting out money, great banks whereof they brought over into England, differing little from Jews, save that they were more merciless to their debtors. Some will have them called Caursines, quasi causa ursini, so bearish and cruel in their causes, others Caursini, quasi Corrasini, from scraping all together. Fuller, lib. 3. pag. 59, 61.
