Septuagesima, is a Sunday certain, being always the next but one before Shrove Sunday, from which, till the Octaves of Easter, the solemnizing of marriage is by the Cannon Laws forbidden; that being a time of mourning, for the fall of Adam, and misery of man thereon ensuing; And Easter with its Octaves is a time of Christs glorification, and so of ours also in him, for his, and, by him, our conquest over death and sin; And that therefore all carnal affection ought during that space to be wholy mortified in us. See Quinquagesima.
