Paris, the son of Priamus, and Hecuba, he was also called Alexander, whom his mother caused to be nursed up privately on the Mountain Ida by the shepherds, where, coming to age he fell in Love with the Nymph Oenone, and lying with her, had two Children by her; afterwards, there growing a contention between the three goddesses, Juno, Pallas, and Venus, they agreed to submit themselves to the judgement of Paris; Juno proffering him a Kingdom, Pallas wisdom, and Venus the handsomest of women, whereupon he gave his judgement for Venus; soon after he was returned home, he was sent into Greece as an Ambassadour to demand Hesione, and being intertained by Menelaus, he fell in Love with Helena his wife, and Menelaus being absent about some affairs, he soon won her to his desires, and carried her away with him by stealth, whereupon there immediately grew a violent warre between the Greeks and the Trojans, wherein after nine years siege Troy was taken, and Paris (having shot Achilles in the heel with his Bow and Arrows in the Temple of Apollo, whither he had led him under pretence of marrying him to his sister Polixena) was himself slain by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles.
