Deodand (deodandum) is a thing given or forfeited (as it were) to God, for the pacification of his wrath in a case of misadventure, whereby any Christian Soul comes to a violent end, without the fault of any reasonable creature. For example, If a horse should strike his keeper, and so kill him: If a man in driving a Cart, and seeking to redress any thing about it, should so fall, as the Cart-wheel running over him, should press him to death: If one should be felling of a tree, and giving warning to company by, when the tree were near falling, to look to themselves, and any of them should be slain nevertheless by the fall of the tree. In the first of these cases, the Horse; In the second, the Cart-wheel, Cart and Horses; and in the third, the Tree is to be given to God, that is to be sold and distributed to the poor for an expiation of this dreadful event, though effected by unreasonable creatures. Stawnf. pl. Cor. l 1. ca. 2. And though this be given to God, yet is it forfeited to the King by Law, as sustaining Gods person, and an Executioner in this case to see the price of these distributed to the poor, &c. Fleta saith, that this is sold, and the price distributed to the poor, for the soul of the King, his Ancestors, and all faithful people departed this life. l. 1. ca. 25. de submersis.
