Misseltoe, or Misseldin, (in Dutch Mistel) a certain plant which grows not upon the ground, but upon other trees, of which it is reported, that Thrushes eating the berries of this plant and afterwards sitting to roust all night, and shitting upon it, causeth it to bear bird-lime, whence cometh the Proverb, The Thrush shits her own sorrow.
