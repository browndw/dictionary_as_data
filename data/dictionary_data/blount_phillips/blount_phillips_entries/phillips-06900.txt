Labda, the daughter of Amphion of the Race of the Bacchidae, she being lame and despised by the rest of the Bacchidae married Aetion, to whom she brought forth Cypselus, so called from a certain Corn measure, wherein his mother hid him from the ten men, whom the Corinthians by a publick decree ordained to kill him, because it had been foretold by the Oracle that a son of Labda should invade the Tyranny of Corinth.
