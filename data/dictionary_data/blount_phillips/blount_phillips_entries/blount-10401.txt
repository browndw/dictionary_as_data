These Knights Templars bore for their Arms, a Shield Argent, charged with a Cross Gules, and upon the Nombril of it, a holy Lamb. And Mat. Paris saith, on their common Seal was engraven a horse with two men riding on him. But the Society of the Inner Temple have taken for their Ensign or Devise, a Pegasus, or flying Horse, sable or gules upon a Shield Or. Over the door of the Temple Church was this inscription in antient characters, remaining legible till April 1656. since which time the latter part of it is defaced. aAnno ab incarnatione domini MCLXXXV. dedicata haec Ecclesia in honorem beatae Mariae A Domino Eraclio Dei gratiae Sanctae resurrectionis Ecclesiae Patriarcha, quarto Idus Februarii, qui eam annatim petentibus, de injuncta sibi penitentia, LX. dies indulsit.
