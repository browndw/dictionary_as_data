Enoch or Enos pillars. The story runs shortly thus; Enos (the son of Seth the son of Adam) who is held to be the first Author of Astrology, having heard his Grandfather Adam say, all things should be destroyed by the universal Flood, was desirous that Science should not perish, before it came to the knowledge of men, did therefore erect two Pillars, one of stone, the other of brick, to the intent, if the brick wasted with water or storms, yet the stone should preserve the Letters whole and perfect; and in these Pillars were graved all that concerns the observations of the stars, &c. one of which Josephus affirms remained even in his time. See Astronomy.
