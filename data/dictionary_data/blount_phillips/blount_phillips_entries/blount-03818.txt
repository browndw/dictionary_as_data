Euphorbium, A gum or tear of a strange plant growing on Mount Atlas in Lybia. It is yellowish, clear, and brittle. It may be used in Oyntments against Palsies, Cramps, and shrinking of sinews; but to be taken inwardly is very dangerous, unless the malice of it be well corrected, for it is exceeding hot in the fourth degree. Bull.
