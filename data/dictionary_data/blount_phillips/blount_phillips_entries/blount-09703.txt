Solecism (soloecismus) a false manner of speaking, contrary to the rules of Grammer, incongruity; Any thing done out of order, or contrary to rule, may be termed a Solecism. It arose from those, who being Athenians born, and dwelling in Soli, a City in Cilicia, spake not pure Attic, but mixt with the Solian's more barbarous Language.
