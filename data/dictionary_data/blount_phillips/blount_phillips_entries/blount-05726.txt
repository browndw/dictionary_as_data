Iubile (jubilaeus annus) a year of rejoycing or remission. Among the Hebrews every fiftieth year, was called the year of Jubile; for then were bond-men of their own Country made free, possessions returned again to the first owners, neither was it lawful to plant or sow any thing that year. Among Christians this solemnity of keeping a year of Jubile, was first instituted by Bonifacius the Eighth, in the year of our Lord 1300, who ordained, that it should be observed every hundreth year. After this Clement the sixth, instituted it to be kept every fiftieth year; and lastly Sixtus the fourth brought it to be celebrated every twenty fifth year, beginning it first in the year of our Lord God 1475, and so it continues. The word is derived from the Hebrew Jobel, which signifies a Ram or a Rams horn, so called (as Masius helps it out) from Jubal, the Father of those who play on the Harp and Organ, Gen. 4.21. And when the Jubile came a great sound of Trumpets, and Rams horns was to be made through all Israel, in sign of the Remissions. Greg.
