In Paris Les Consula cent , are five honest and substantial Citizens, who determine all cases of debt (not exceeding 4000 li. Turnois) between Merchant and Merchant: Their authority continues but a year, and the utmost punishment they can inflict, is but imprisonment. In most Cities of Aquitain, the chief Governors are termed Consuls; the rest of the good Towns in France have such Consuls, as Paris, by the names of Les Judges & Consuls des Merchands. Cotgr.
