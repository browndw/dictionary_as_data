Minotaur (Minotaurus) a Poetical monster, half like a Man, half like a Bull, was kept in the Labyrinth of Candy, and fed with mans flesh, where at last he was slain by Thesus, through the help of Ariadne. This Fable was built upon this foundation; that one Taurus, a Servant of Minos got his Mistris Pasiphae with child, from whence the Infant was named Minotaurus.
