Gule, or Yule of August, (may come from the Brit. Gwil, i. festum, or from the Lat. jubilum) the first day of August, called in old Almanacks St. Peter advincula, and in our later Almanacks, Lammas day. An. 27. E. 3. Stat. 3. cap. unico. Fitz. nat. br. fo. 62.1 called Gule of August, alias Goule de August. a cent . Plow. casu Mines, fo. 316. b. It is the very day of St. Peter ad vincula, which was wont and is still, within the limits of the Roman Catholick Church, celebrated upon the very Calends of August. It is by some conjectured that Gule comes of the Latin Gula, or the Fr. Gueule, the throat. The reason of this conjecture is (in Durands rationali divinor. l. 7. ca. de festo S. Petri ad vincula) That one Quirinus a Tribune, having a Daughter who had a disease in her throat, went to Alexander then Pope of Rome, the sixth from St. Peter, and desired him to borrow or see the chains that St. Peter was chained with under Nero: which request obtained, his said Daughter kissing the said Chains, was cured of her disease, and Quirinus, with his family were baptized. Tuna cent dictus Alexander Papa (saith Durand) hoc festum in Calendis Augusti celebrandum a cent instituit, & in honorem beati Petri Ecclesiam in urbe fabricavit, ubi vincula ipse reposuit, & ad vincula nominavit, & Calendis Augusti dedicavit. In qua festivitate, populus illic ipsa vincula hodiA osculatur. So that this day being before called onely the Calends of August, was upon this occasion afterwards termed indifferently, either of the instrument that wrought this miracle, St. Peters day ad vincula, or of that part of the Maiden, whereon the miracle was wrought, the Gule of August. See Lammas day.
