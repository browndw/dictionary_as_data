Tribe (tribus) a kindred or company, that dwell together in one Ward or Liberty; as the people of Rome were divided into thirty five Tribes, Bands, Wards, or Hundreds; It seems in old time the same people were divided into three parts only, and that this name Tribus did thence first arise. Tribes in Scripture signifie the posterity of the twelve Sons of Israel. Psal. 78.55. Numb. 13.3, 5, 16.
