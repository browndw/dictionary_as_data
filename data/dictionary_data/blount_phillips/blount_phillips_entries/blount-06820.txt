Muscadel (Fr.) or Muscadine (Vinum Muscatum) a kind of wine so called, because for sweetness and smell it resembles Musk. This wine comes for the most part from the Isle Creta or Candy; whence (as Ortelius reports) 12000 Butts of it are yearly transported. Others say it takes name from Monte Alcino in Italy.
