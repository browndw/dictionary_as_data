August (augustus) taken adjectively signifies Royal, Majestical, Imperial, Sacred; It is a common name of the Emperors among the Latins (as Pharao was of the Kings of Egypt) since Octavius Augustus his time, who was the second Emperor of the Romans. In the 41 or 42 year of his reign was born our Saviour Jesus Christ. August also is the name of the Sextile or sixth moneth from March; which took denomination from the aforesaid Emperor Augustus, because that month he entered into his Consulship, brought Triumphs into Rome, and conquered Egypt.
