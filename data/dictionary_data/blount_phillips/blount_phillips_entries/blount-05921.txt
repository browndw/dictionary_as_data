Laurel (laurus) a Bay-tree. In antient Rome the Triumphers used to be crowned with Laurel, and the Captain that triumphed carried a branch of it in his hand. So is the Triumph of Scipio Affricanus described by Appianus Alexandrinus, Plin. lib. 6. The Laurel was consecrated to Apollo, because on mount Parnassus there grew great store of it. Some affirm it has the property not to be hurt by lightning, therefore the Cock resorts thereto in Tempests, as Natural Historians testifie; conform to which, is the Imprese of him, who caused to be painted a Cock under a Laurel with this Motto, SIC EVITABILE FAELMEN.
