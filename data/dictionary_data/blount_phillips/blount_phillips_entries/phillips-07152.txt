Leucothoe, the daughter of Orchamus King of the Babylonians, with whom Apollo being in love, transformed himself into the shape of Eurynome her mother, & pretending private businesse with her, he re-assumed his former shape, and won her by fair speeches to consent to his desires; whereupon Clytia, who was in love with Apollo, growing extreamly envious, declared the whole businesse to Orchamus, who in a great fury caused his daughter to be buried alive, whose death Apollo grieving at, transformed her into the Frankincense-tree, and Clytia seeing her self contemned of Apollo, pined her self away, and was turned into a Marygold.
