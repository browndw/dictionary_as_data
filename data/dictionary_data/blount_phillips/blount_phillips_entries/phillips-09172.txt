Phineus, the son of Agenor, or as others say of Phoenix and Cassiopaea, he was King of Thrace, and had by his first wife Cleopatra, Orythus and Crambus, whose eyes he put out at the perswasion of his second wife Harpalice the sister of Zethes and Calais, for which he was strucken blind himself, and the Harpyes were sent against him who continually defiled his meat as it came to his table; but at last they were driven by Zethes and Calais into the Strophades Islands, and Phineus himself was killed by Hercules after he understood that the children were blinded without a cause.
