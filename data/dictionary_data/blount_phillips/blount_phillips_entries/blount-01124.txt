The reason why it is called bayl is, because by this means the party restrained is delivered into the hands of those that bind themselves for his forth-coming. There is both common and special bayl; common bayl is in actions of small prejudice, or slight proof, in which case any Sureties are taken; whereas upon cases of greater weight special bail or Surety must be given, as Subsidy men at the least, and they according to the value. See the difference between bail and mainprize in Manwoods Forest Law. pag. 267.
