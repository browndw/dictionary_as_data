Sumage, seems to be Toll for carriage on horse-back. Crompt. juris. fol. 191. for the book called Pupilla oculi, hath these words pro uno equo portante Summagium per dimidium anni, obulum. It is otherwise called a Seam; and a Seam, in the Western parts is a horse load, which word Seam and Sumage may well come of the Fr. Somme, i. Sarcina, and SommiAr, equus sarcinarius, a Sumpter-horse.
