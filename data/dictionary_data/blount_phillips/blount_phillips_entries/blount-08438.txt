Prorogue (prorogo) to prolong, defer, or put off till another day, to continue. As we say the Parliament is Prorogued, when it is adjourned or put off for some time, but not ended. The Romans (if they did impose a law to be made by the people) were said rogare legem, because of asking, moving or perswading to enact the same, velitis jubeatisne Quirities, &c. from whence came Prorogare legem, to continue a Law which was in being, for a longer time, and abrogare to repeal or abrogate it for the time to come, unless, upon some further consideration, it were thought fit to be restored.
