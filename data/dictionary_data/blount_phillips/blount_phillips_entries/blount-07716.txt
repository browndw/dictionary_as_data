Penitencer Penitenciary (from penitentia) the Priest, &c. that enjoyns the offender his penance. Penitentiary is sometimes taken for that place in Rome, where certain Priests, indued with faculties to absolve from reserved cases are appointed to sit, ready to hear the Confessions of those that from sundry places repair to them for that purpose.
