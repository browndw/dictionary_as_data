Lohoch or Loch, a Physical word, and is a thick Syrrup, or other soft substance, or confection, which must not be swallowed, but suffered to melt of it self in the mouth, that so it may gently slide down, and thereby have the more vertue against diseases of the Brest, Lungs and throat. Culpepper says, it is an Arabick word, and simply signifies a thing to be licked up.
