Domini or Anno Domini, is the computation of time from the Incarnation of our Saviour Jesus Christ. As the Romans made their computation from the building the City of Rome; and the Grecians numbered their years by the Olympiads or Games called Olympick. So Christians, in remembrance of the happy Incarnation, and blessed birth of our Saviour, reckon the time from his Nativity. See Epoch.
