Whitsunday, Pentecost, Whitsontide (i. albi solis tempus) is a solemn Feast in memory and honor of the coming of the holy Ghost upon the heads of the Apostles, in tongues, as it were of fire. (Act. 2.3.) Pentecost in Greek signifies the fiftieth, it being the fiftieth day from the Resurrection. It is also called VVhitsunday from the Catechumens, who were clothed in white, and admitted on the Eve of this Feast to the Sacrament of Baptism.
