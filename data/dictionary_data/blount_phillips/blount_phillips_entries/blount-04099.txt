Fealty, (of the Fr. feaulte, i. fidelitas) signifies in our Common Law an oath taken at the admittance of every Tenant, to be true to the Lord of whom he holds his Land. And he that holds Land by this oath of fealty, onely holds in the freest manner that any man in Engl. under the King may hold. Because all with us that have Fee, hold per fidem & fiduciam, that is, by fealty at the least, Smith de Repub. Anglor. l. 3. c. 8. Act 1656. c. 4.
