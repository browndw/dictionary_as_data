Spher (Lat.) an Indian, and Aethiopian Beast, rough bodied like an Ape (of the kinde whereof he is) yet hairless between his Neck and Brest, round, but out-faced, and Brested like a woman, his unarticulate voice like that of a hasty speaker, more gentle and tameable then an ordinary Ape, yet fierce by nature, and revengefull, when he is hurt; having eaten meat enough, he reserves his Chaps full to feed on when he feels himself hungry again.
