Sergeanty (from the Fr. Sergeant, or Sergent, i. one retained to guard ones person) signifies in our Common Law, a service due to the King, from his Tenant holding by such service; For this service cannot be due to any Lord from his Tenant, but to the King onely. And this is either grand or petit, as you shall find in Littletons Tenures, and Br. l. 2. c. 26.
