Attainder, from the Fr. Attaindre, i. to attain unto, overtake, catch, or touch, from the Latin attingere, because he that is attainted, is as it were, catched, overtaken and plainly deprehended: for Attainder is a conviction of any person of a crime or fault, whereof he was not convict before: As if a man have committed Felony or Treason, &c. and is thereof indicted, arraigned, found guilty, and hath judgement, then he is said to have an Attainder sued upon him, or he is attainted.
