Nazarite (Heb.) signifies a man separated or divided. The Jews so called those that had vowed themsela cent es for some time to God: And these Nazarites, while their vow lasted, were to abstain from Wine and Grapes either green or dry, and generally, from whatever came from the Vine Tree, or might make a man drunk. They also cut not their hair, and observed divers other ceremonies. The date of their vow being expired, they presented themselves to the Priest, who offered a Sacrifice for them, and then their hair was cut, and burnt with the Sacrifice; after which it was lawful for them to drink wine as before. See Numb. 6.2.21. The Disciples were first called Nazarites (as the Mahumetans still call them) from Jesus of Nazareth (a Village in Galilee) as now, Christians from Christ; which name was first given them at Antioch by Evodus, Patriack thereof, who immediately succeeded St. Peter. Also certain Heretics so called. Of which see Moses and Aaron, p. 32.
