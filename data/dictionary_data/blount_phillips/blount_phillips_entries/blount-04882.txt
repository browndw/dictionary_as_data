Hia cent rommia cent ns, a Religious Order that had their beginning of St. Hierome, who leaving his Native Country, went into Jury, and there, not far from Bethelem, lived in a Monastery very devoutly, the latter end of his life, and died in the 91 year of his age, and of Christ 421. The Monks of this Order wear their Cloaths of a brown colour, and a Cope plaited over their Coat, girt with a leathern Girdle. There were also certain Hermites called Hieronimians, of the foundation of one Charls Granel of Florence, who (about the year of Christ, 1365) became an Hermite in the Mountains of Fessulus.
