Knights Fee, is sometime used for the Rent that a Knight pays for his Fee to the Lord of whom he holds; and this an uncertain sum, some holding by forty shillings the Shield, some by twenty shillings, as appears by Bracton. lib. 5. Tract. 1. cap. 2. My Lo. Coke, in his ninth Book of Reports, saith, A Knights Fee is estimated by the value of the Land, viz. 20l. annual. An Hide of Land is as much as one Plough can break up in a year: Relief the fourth part of the annual value of the Land, viz. of a Knight 5 l. of a Baron 100 Marks, an Earl a 100l. a Marquis, 200 Marks, a Duke 200 l.
