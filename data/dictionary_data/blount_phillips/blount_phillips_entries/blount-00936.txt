Assignee (assignatus) is he that is appointed or deputed by another to do any act, or perform any business, or enjoy any commodity. And an Assignee may be either in Deed, or in Law. Assignee in Deed, is he that is appointed by a person: an Assignee in Law, is he whom the Law so makes, without any appointment of the person. Dyer fol. 6. num. 5. Perkins Tit. Grants, saith, that an Assignee is he that useth or enjoys a thing in his own right, and Deputy he that doth it in the right of another.
