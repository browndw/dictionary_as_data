Helchesaites (so named of a false Prophet called Helchesaus) divulged their heresie in the time of Pope Fabian the first: These men did altogether reprove the Apostle St. Paul, renewing the errors of Cerinthus, Ebion and the Nazarians; saying it was no sin to deny Jesus Christ in the time of persecution, &c. Euseb. in hist. Eccles. l. 6. ca. 28. Nicephor. in lib. 5. ca. 24.
