Fleet (Fleta) is a famous Prison in London, so called, as it seems, from the River, upon the side whereof it stands. Camb. Brit. fol. 137. To this Prison none are usually committed, but for contempt to the Laws, or upon absolute commandment of the King; or the Superiour Courts of Justice; or lastly, upon debt, when men are unable or unwilling to satisfie their Creditors.
