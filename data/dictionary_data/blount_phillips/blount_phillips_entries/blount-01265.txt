Bigamy (bigamia) the marriage of two wives; It is used in our Common Law for an impediment to be a Clerk, and makes a prisoner lose the benefit of the Clergy. For the Canonists hold, that he that has been twice married may not be a Clerk; and they ground it upon these words of St. Paul, 1 Tim. 3.2. Oportet ergo Episcopum irreprehensibilem esse, & unius uxoris virum. And also him that hath married a widow, they by interpretation take to have been twice married, and both these they not onely exclude from Holy Orders, but deny all priviledges of Clergy; but this Law is abolished by Anno 1. Ed. 6. cap. 12. And to that may be added the Statute of 18 Eliz. cap. 7. which allows to all men, that can read as Clarks, though not within Orders, the benefit of Clergy in case of Felony, not especially excepted by some other Statute.
