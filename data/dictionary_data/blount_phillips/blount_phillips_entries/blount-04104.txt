Fecial (faecialis) pertaining to the Herald that denounceth war or peace: The manner was thus; The Faecialis carried a Lance or Spear headed with Iron, and half burnt with fire, and strewed herbs all the way in sign of peace, even to the confines of those against whom he was to menace war; there in the presence of three men of good years, declared, that he and the people of Rome did denounce war against them, &c. And then threw the Lance as far as he could upon their ground. When they proclaimed Peace, the Faecialis took up a stone in his hand, which (after certain solemn words pronounced, and those to be read in Godwins Anthol. lib. 4. cap. 1.) he cast out of his hand, &c. And of these Foeciales or Heralds, there were in Rome a Colledge of twenty, the principal of them was Pater patratus.
