Quinquereme (Quinqueremis) is a Galley, wherein every Oar hath five men to draw it; the Quadriremes had four to an Oar; and the Triremes, three. Some have thought that the Quinqueremes had five ranks of Oars, one over another, and the other Galleys ratably fewer; but had this been so, they must then have had five Decks, each over other, which has seldom been seen in ships of a thousand Tuns; nor could the third, fourth or fifth ranks have reached the water with their Oars. Sir Wat. Ral. Hist. l. 5. Also a little ship or Galley that has five Oars on a side.
