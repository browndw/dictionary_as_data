Ostracism (ostracismus) a kind of banishment among the Athenians for ten years, which was done by delivering a shell (ostratos) with the condemned persons name written in it; it was used not so much to punish other offences, as to abate the immoderate power of Noblemen, and was ordained first by Clistenes, who for his labor was first condemned.
