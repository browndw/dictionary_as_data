Cristal (chrystalus) a Mineral substance like clear glass or ice. There are two kinds hereof; one which grows upon extream cold Mountains, being there congealed like Ice, by the Mineral vertue of the place, as Albertus writes. Another that grows in the earth in some places of Germany. See more of the nature and properties of it in Dr. Browns Vul. Er. l. 2. cap 1.
