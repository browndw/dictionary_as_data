A Vidame was originally the Judge of a Bishops Temporal Jurisdiction, or such an Officer to him, as the Vicount was to the Count or Earl, but in process of time, of an Officer, he became a Lord, by altering his Office into a Fief, held of the Bishoprick he belonged to; so that even to this day the Estate of all Vidames depends of some Bishoprick, or is annexed to the Temporalities thereof, and therefore they are no better then Seignieurs Mediocres (as the French say) though the first of that rank; and in all other Priviledges and Rights equal to Vicounts, with some advantage of credit, in respect of high Jurisdiction, which those have usurped by degrees upon their Earls; and these had at the first, by the gift of their Bishops.
