This Alleluia (saith a learned Author) is an Hebrew word, composed of Allelu and Jah, whereof the Imperative Mood Allelu (as near as can be uttered, for in it self it signifies joy beyond all utterance) is as much as praise ye; and the word Jah is one of the ten names signifying our Lord, which some think to be the first word that children pronounce, when they are new born. This word Alleluiah the Jews much esteem, and pronounce many times together in their Synagogues.
