Wreck, (Fr. Varech, Lat. Veriscum & naufragium) is when a ship perisheth at sea, and no man escapeth alive, in which case whatever goods are cast upon land belong to the King or the Lord of the soile; but if any person come to land, or if either dog or cat escape alive, the goods return to the owner if he claim them within a year and a day.
