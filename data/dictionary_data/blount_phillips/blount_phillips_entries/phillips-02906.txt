Constable, quasi comes stabuli, or Master of the Kings horse, or as others say, derived from the Dutch word Konnin-Stable, i. e. prop and stay of the King. This word is diversly taken in Common law, either for the Constable of England, a place formerly of great Dignity, or for an office belonging heretofore to the Lords of certain Mannours, and at length there came to be ordained others of an inferiour rank, as Constables of Hundreds, or Franchises who were appointed for the conservation of the peace, and called high Constables; and under these the Constables of every Town or Parish, who are called pety-constables.
