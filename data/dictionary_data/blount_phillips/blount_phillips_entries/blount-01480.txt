Calends (calendae) properly the first day of every month, being spoken by it self, or the very day of the New Moon, which commonly did fall out together; If Pridie be placed before it, then it signifies the last day of the foregoing month, as Pridie Calend. Maii, is the last day of April. If any number be placed with it, it signifies that day in the former moneth, which comes so much before the moneth named; as the tenth Calends of October, is the twentieth day of September, because if one begin at October, and reckon backwards, that twentieth day of September, is the tenth day before October. In March, May, July, and October, the Calends begin at the 16 day, in other moneths at the fourteenth; which Calends must ever bear the name of the moneth following, and be numbred backward from the first day of the said following moneths. See more in Hoptons Concord. p. 69. and see Ides.
