Neap Tides, In the Seamens Dialect are, the ebbing or small Tydes, which happen when the Moon is in the middle of the second and last Quarter; The Neap is opposite to the Spring, and there are as many days allowed for the Neap or falling of the Tides, as for the Spring or rising of them. The Tide never runs so swift in Neaps as in Springs. Note that as the highest of the Spring is three days after the Full or Change of the Moon; So the lowest of the Neap is four days before the Full or Change, and then they say 'tis Dead-neap. When a ship wants water, so that it doth not flow high enough to bring her off the ground, or out of a Dock, they say she is be-neaped. See Spring-Tides.
