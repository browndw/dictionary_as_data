Date (dactylus) a kind of sweet fruit brought from Numidia and other far Countries. The Date Trees are some male, some female: the first brings forth only flowers, the other fruit; yet herein is the male beneficial to the encrease of the Dates; for, unless a flowred bough of the male be ingraffed into the female, the Dates never prove good.
