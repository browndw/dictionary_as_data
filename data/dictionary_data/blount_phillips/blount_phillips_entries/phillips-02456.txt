Cinque-ports, five Havens which lie toward France on the East part of England: namely, Hastings, Dover, Hith, Rumney, and Sandwich; the inhabitants of these Ports have many priviledges and immunities above others of the Commons of that Country. Also they have an especial Governoura who is called Lord-warden of the Cinque-ports, having all the authority that a Lord Admiral hath in places not exempted.
