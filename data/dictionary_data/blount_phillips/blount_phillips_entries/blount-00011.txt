Abeyance or Abayence (from the Fr. Bayer, i. to gape, covet, or expect) our Lawyers would signifie hereby a kind of hope or longing expectance; because those things that are in Abeyance, though for the present in no man, yet they are, in hope and expectation, belonging to him who is next to enjoy them. When the Parson of a Church dies, we say the Freehold is in abeyance (because the Church is in expectation of a successor) in Potentia, as Logicians phrase it. Co. on Lit. l. 3. c. 11. Sect. 646.
