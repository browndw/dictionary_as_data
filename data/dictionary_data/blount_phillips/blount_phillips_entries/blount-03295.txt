Dulcarron is a proportion in Euclid (lib. 1. Theor. 33. Propos. 47.) which was found out by Pythagoras after a whole years study, and much beating his brain; in thankfulness whereof, he sacrificed an Oxe to the Gods; which sacrifice he called Dulcarnon. Alex. Neckam, an antient writer in his book De naturis rerum, compounds this word of Dulia and caro, and will have Dulcarnon to be quasi Sacrificium carnis. Chaucer aptly applies it to Creseide; shewing, that she was as much amazed how to answer Troilus, as Pythagoras was wearied in bringing his desire to effect.
