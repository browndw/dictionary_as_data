Ambergreece or Ambergrise (Fr. Ambergris) a sweet Aromatick juice or perfume so called. Aetius and Simon Sethius (Greek Authors) affirm it to be a kinde of Bitumen comming forth of the Fountains or Springs in the bottom of the Sea, and that by floating upon the water it becomes hard, &c. A great quantity thereof is found in Sofala, and in the Isles of Comaro, Demogra, Mozambique, and along this Tract even to the Isles of Maldina or Naledina, which look into the East. There is Amber of four several colours; White, Gray, Red, and Black, which comes according to the variety of places or Regions where it is found; the Gray is preferred before all the other, and is known to be good, if when pricking it with a pin, it delivers forth a moisture like oyle. The fume of it is good against the falling-sickness, and comfortable to the brain.
