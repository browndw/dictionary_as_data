Manna (Gr.) man, or the dew of heaven; a delicate food, wherewith God fed the children of Israel, it falling from heaven in manner of a dew, white, and somewhat like Coriander seed; with which the Israelites lived forty years in the Wilderness, till they came to the Borders of the Land of Canaan. At first sending hereof the people were in such admiration that they said to each other, manhu? i. quid est hoc? what is this? which seems to be the cause why it was afterward called Manna. In Physick it is taken for a kind of dew, or grained Manna, which, falling in hot Countries upon trees and herbs before break of day, doth there congeal, almost like crums of white bread, and is gathered and choicely kept, as a gentle purger of Choler; it is sweet of taste; the best comes from Calabria, where they gather it from the leaf of the Mulberry Tree. Nat. hist. 165. It is also taken for any sweet matter extracted out of any thing.
