Corody Corrody (from corrodo, to eat together) signifies in our Common Law a sum of money, or allowance of meat and drink, due to the King from an Abbey or other House of Religion, whereof he is Founder, towards the reasonable sustenance of such a one of his Servants, being put to his Pension, as he thinks good to bestow it on. And the difference between a Corrody and a Pension seems to be, that a Corrody is allowed towards the maintenance of any of the Kings servants, that live in the Abby; a Pension is given to one of the Kings Chaplains, for his better maintenance in the Kings service, till he may be provided a Benefice. Cow. Of both these read Fitz. nat. br. fol. 230, 231, 233.
