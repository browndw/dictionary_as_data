Haracana or Hero-cane (perhaps from the Span. Arancar, to weed up or pull up by the roots) an impetuous kind of Tempest or Whirlwind, happening in the Indies, and those remote Countries, which comes with such violence that it overturns trees by the roots, blows down houses, &c. and continues sometimes thirty days; Mariners and Seamen stand in great fear of it at Sea; for it infallibly wrecks their ships. And some affirm, the Devil appears often to the Pagans in these Haracanes. Mr. Herb. says it happens in some Countries but once in nine years.
