Baltick-Sea (so called from a great Peninsula formerly called Baltia now Scandia) is that which begins at the narrow passage called the Sound, interlaceth Denmark, Swedland, Germany, and Poland, and extends even to Livonia and Lituania. The reasons why this Sea being so large does not ebb and flow, are first, The narrowness of the Streight, by which the Ocean is let into it. And secondly, The Northern situation of it, whereby the celestial influences produce therein the lesser operation. Heyl.
