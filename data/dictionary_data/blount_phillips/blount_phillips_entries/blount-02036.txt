Codicil (codicillus) a diminutive of Code or Codex) a little book, a Schedule or supplement to a Will, also a letter missive. Writers conferring a Testament and a Codicil together, call a Testament a great Will, and a Codicil a little one, and compare a Testament to a ship, and the Codicil to a boat tied to the said ship. Codicils are now used as additions annexed to the Testament, when any thing is omitted which the Testator would add, or any thing put in, which he would retract. A Codicil is the same that a Testament is, but that it is without an executor. See Swinburn in his Treatise of Testaments, and Wills, p. 1. sect. 5.
