Pandora fained (by Hesiedus) to be the first woman, and made by Vulcan; indued by all the gods, with several excellent gifts; but afterwards by Jupiter, in displeasure sent to her Spouse Epimetheus, with a box full of all manner of miseries. Hence Pandora's Box is taken for misery, calamity, and the like.
