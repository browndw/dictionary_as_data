Ordael or Ordeal (ordalium) signifies as much as judgement, and is compounded (as some say) of two Saxon words Or, a privatitive, as [A] in Greek, and dael, i. a cent ars, q Expers. But it is artificially used for a kind of purgation, practised in antient times, whereby the party purged was judged Expers criminis, called in the Common Law, Purgatio vulgaris, and utterly condemned by Pope Steven the second. There was of this four sorts, one by Kampfight (not unlike our Duel.) The second called Fire-Ordeal, which was for the accused to pass blindfold with bare feet over hot Plowshares, &c. (of which see Mr. Fullers hist. Cent. 11. p. 141.) The third was hot water-Ordeal, by putting his arms up to the elbows in seething water, &c. The fourth was cold water-Ordeal, like the late used trial of Witches. Of these at large, see Verstegan, p. 50, 51. and Lambert in his explication of Saxon words, Verbo Ordalium, where he expresses such superstitions as were used in it. Mr. Manwood part 1. pag. 15.
