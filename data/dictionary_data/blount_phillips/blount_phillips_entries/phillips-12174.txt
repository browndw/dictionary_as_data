Woodstock, (Sax. a wooddy place) a Town in Oxfordshire, where King Ethelred assembled the States of the Kingdom and enacted Laws; here King Henry the first built a very magnificent Royal Palace, in which King Henry the second, that he might keep his Paramour Rosamund Clifford concealed, built a Labyrinth with many intricate turnings and windings, which was called Rosamunds Bower; but it is so utterly effaced, that at this day it is not to be discerned where it was. In this Town Geffery Chaua cent er a most famous English Poet was brought up.
