In our Common Law, Divorce is accounted that separation between two de facto married together, which is A vinculo Matrimonii, non solAm A mensa & thoro. And therefore the woman, so divorced, received all again that she brought with her. This is onely upon a nullity of the marriage through some essential impediment, as Consanguinity or affinity within the degrees forbidden, precontract, impotency, or such like. See The new terms of Law.
