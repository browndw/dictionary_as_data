Confiscate from confisco, and that (with the Fr. Confisquer) from Fiscus, which originally signifies a Hamper, Pannier, Basket, or Freil; but Metonymically, the Emperors Treasure, because it was antiently kept in such Hampers: And though our Kings kept not their treasure in such things, yet as the Romans said, that such goods as were forfeited to the Emperors Treasury for any offence, were bona confiscata, so we say, those that are forfeited to our Exchequer, are confiscated. See more of Goods confiscate in Stawnf. Pl. Cor. l. 3. ca. 24.
