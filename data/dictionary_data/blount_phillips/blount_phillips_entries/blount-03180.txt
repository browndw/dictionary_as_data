The second Branch of Natural Divination is that, which a wise man may foretell by probable conjecture, being no way offensivea so long as it is onely guided by reason, and over-ruled by submitting it self to the Almighty power of God. And to this second kind of Divination, Astrology may also be referred which (by the motion and influence of Stars and Planets) promises to foretel many things, so long as it keeps it self in due limits and arrogates not too much to the certainty thereof; into which excess of vanity, if it once break forth, it is then no longer called Natural Divination, but Superstitious and wicked; For the Stars may incline, but not impose a necessity on particular things.
