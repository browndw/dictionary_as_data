Legion (legio) an Army or Band of men. At first Romulus his Legion consisted of 3000 footmen and 300 horse, after of 4200 foot, and 300 horse, and after that 5000 foot, and 300 horse. Isid 9.3. saith, a Legion consisted of 6000 armed men, which number is seldom or never exceeded, as it appears by Sigonius de jure Rom. l. 1. cap. 15. The Romans did very seldom enroll into their universal Army, above four Legions, and in an ordinary Legion, ten Cohorts, every Cohort containing three Maniples, every Maniple two Centuries, every Century 100 Soldiers. Goodw. p. 175.
