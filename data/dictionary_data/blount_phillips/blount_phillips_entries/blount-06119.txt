Lollarda cent (Lollardi) a Sect that abounded in England in the days of Edw. 3. and Hen. 5 An. 2. H. 5. ca. 7. of these read Stows Annals p. 425. Tritemius, in his Chronicle, deduces the name from one Gualter Lolhard, a German, as the first author of that Sect, living about the year 1315. And Chilian says, Lollardus fuit Alexianus Monachus, & Lollardus quoque dicitur Haereticus Valdersis. These Lolhards were much consenting with the Wicklevites in opinions; they began in time of P. Innocent the sixth, and Charles the fourth Emperor of that name, (says another Author.) See their Tenets in B. Spotswoods hist. of Scotl. fol. 61.
