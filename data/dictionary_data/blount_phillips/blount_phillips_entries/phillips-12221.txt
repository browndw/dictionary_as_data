Zethus, the son of Jupiter and Antiope the wife of Lycus King of the Thebans, who divorcing Antiope, married Dirce; after which Jupiter falling in love with Antiope, got her with child, which Dirce perceiving, fearing lest she might come again into favour with her Husband, she put her in prison; but the time of her delivery drawing nigh, she was set at liberty, and flying to the mountain Citheron, she brought forth twins in the highway, and the children being afterwards found by the Shepherds, were brought up by them, and called the one Zethus, the other Amphion, who coming to age, and hearing of the injuries which Dirce had done to their mother, they tied her to the tail of a wild Bull, whereby she was draged through rough and stony wayes to a miserable death, and changed by Bacchus into a Fountain.
