Palladion (Spa.) Lat. Palladium) an Image of Pallas, which the Trojans fondly believed was sent to preserve their City and Estate, &c. which sottish belief St. Augustine (lib. 9. de Civ. Dei) very well reproved, when he said, The Trojans were keepers of the Palladion, but not the Palladion of the Trojans. However, this word is still used for a preservation or sure defence.
