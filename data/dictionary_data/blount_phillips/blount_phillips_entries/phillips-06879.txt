Knight Bachelour, the lowest, but ancientest Order of Knight-hood, and cometh from the Germans, among whom it was an ancient custom, that as soon as the State judged any of their young men fit to manage armes and weapons, and allowed him sufficient for martial exercises, then in the very assembly and council, either one of the Princes, the father, or son of the kinsfolk of the young man, did furnish him with a shield and a javelin, as the Romans did the toga virilis, or Virile gown, to those whom they thought capable of publick imployment, and thenceforth from a part of a private house, he was accounted a member of the Common-wealth. It was also an ancient ceremony to honour men with the Girdle of Knighthood, which he who received, was solemnly to go to Church, and offerring his sword upon the Altar, to vow himself to the service of God; afterwards it came to be usual for Kings to send their sons to the neighbour Princes, to receive Knighthood at their hands; Then it was also that besides the Sword and Girdle, Gilt-Spurs were also added for more ornament, whence in Latin they are called Equia cent es aurati; the word Bachelours some derive from the French Baschevaliers, as it were Knights of the lowest degree; others from Batailler to battel or fight: they are also simply and without any addition called Knights.
