Hawkers, Are certain deceitful fellows, that go from place to place buying and selling Brass, Pewter, and other Merchandize, that ought to be uttered in open Market. The Appellation seems to grow from their uncertain wandering, like those that with Hawks seek their Game where they can finde it. You have the word A. 25. H. 8. ca 6. and An. 33. ejusd. ca. 4. Those people which go up and down the streets crying News-books, and selling them by retail, are also called Hawkers; and the women that sell them by whole sale from the Press, are called Mercury-women.
