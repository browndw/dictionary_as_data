A league, a certain proportion of ground in length onely, consisting of about two, or three miles, it is called in Latin Leuco, from the Greek word Leucos, i. e. white, because formerly the end of every league used to be noted with a white stone, whence ad primum aut secundum lapidem ab urbe, at the first, or second stone from the Citie, was as much as to say, one, or two leagues from the Citie. League is also derived from the Latin word Ligare, and signifieth an agreement, Pact, or Covenant.
