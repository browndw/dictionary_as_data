Sanctuary (sanctuarium) a holy or sanctified place, as Temple, Church or Chappel. In the old Law it was the most holy place of the Tabernacle wherein God gave visible tokens of his presence. Psal. 20.2. And more particularly, it is a place priviledged by the Prince, for the safe-guard of offenders lives, being founded on the Law of Mercy, and on the great reverence and devotion, which the Prince bears to the place, whereunto he grants such a Priviledge. Of this you may read Stawnf. pl. Cor. lib. 2. ca. 38. This seems to have taken beginning from the Cities of Refuge which Moses appointed them to flie unto for safeguard of their lives, that had casually slain a man, Exod. 21. In bastardly imitation whereof, first the Athenians, then Romulus erected such a place of immunity, which they, and he after them called Asylum. The Emperors of Rome made the places of their own Statues or Images, and Churches also places of Refuge, as appears, Cod. l. 1. tit. 15. But among all other Nations, the antient Kings of England seem to have attributed most to these Sanctuaries, permitting them to shelter such, as had committed both Felonies and Treasons, so that within Forty days they acknowledged their fault, and submitted themselves to banishment; During which time, if any man expelled them, if he were Lay, he was Excommunicated; if a Clerk, he was made irregular; but after forty days no man might relieve them, see Fleta lib. 1 cap. 29. And how by degrees they have been taken away, you may read partly in him, and partly in several Statutes.
