Constaa cent (Lat. it is evident, plain, certain) is the name of a kind of Certificate, which the Clerk of the Pipe, or Auditors of the Exchequer make at the request of any person, who intends to plead in that Court for discharge (commonly) of Lands Sequestred; the effect of this Constat is to declare what does constare on Record, as for what cause the lands were sequestred, for what rent letten, and the like; and the Auditors Fee for it, is 13 s. 4 d. A Constat is held to be superior to a Certificat, because this may err or fail in its contents; that cannot, as certifying nothing but what is evident upon Record.
