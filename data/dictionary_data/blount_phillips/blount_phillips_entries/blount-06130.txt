Loray-Law. In the Memorials of the Chamber of Accounts in France, is found an Article to this effect. Si homines de Loraico vadia duelli temere dederint, &c. If a combate were once accepted, and after, by consent of the Lord of the Fee, were taken up, each of the parties should pay 2s. 6d. But if it we performed, then the party vanquished should forfeit 112 s. and upon this custom grew the French Proverb, when any man has had a hard and unjust Judgement, they say he was tried by the Law of Loray or Bern, ou Ie batu paye l' amends, where the vanquished gives the recompence. Sir W. Ral.
