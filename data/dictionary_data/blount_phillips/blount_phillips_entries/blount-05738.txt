Iulep (Arab.) a Physical drink, made either of destilled waters or Syrups mixed together, or of a decoction sweetned with hony or sugar, or else mingled with Syrrops, and ministred commonly as a preparative to open the passage of the inward parts, and fit the humors for a purgation. Some affirm this to be a Persian word, and to signifie properly a sweet potion.
