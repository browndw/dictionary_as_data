Zoilus, a Sophist of Amphipolis, who lived in the time of Ptolomaeus King of Aegypt, and writ a book against Homer, (whence he was called Homeromaa cent tix) which he presented to Pa cent olomy expecting a great reward; but when he saw that he gave him nothing, he being compelled by want, set on some friends to beg something of him; but Ptolomy answea cent ed that since Homer, so many Ages past deceased had fed so many men, he wondred how Zoilus could want so much, being more learned than Homer. Concerning his death some say, that being convicted of Parricide, he was crucified at the command of Ptolomy. Others that returning into Greece, he was thrown down headlong from the rock Sa cent yron. From him every envious carping Critick is called a Zoilus.
