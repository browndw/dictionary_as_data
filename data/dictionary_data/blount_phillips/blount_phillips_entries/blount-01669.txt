Catharists (so called from the Gr. a in non-Latin alphabet a, i. to purge, from certain execrable cleansings or purgings which they used) a branch of the Manichean Hereticks, that appeared first to the world in the time of Pope Felix the first, and of Aurelian the Emperor, about the year of Christ 297. They rejected the Sacraments of the Church, held oaths to be unlawful, and forbidden Christians in all cases, &c. with other such mad positions.
