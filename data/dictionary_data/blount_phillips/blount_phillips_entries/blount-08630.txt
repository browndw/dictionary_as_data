Quaternity (quaternitas) the number four, which (says, Dr. Brown) stands much admired, not onely in the quaternity of the Elements, which are the principles of Bodies, but in the Letters of the name of God, which in the Latin, Greek, Arabian, Persian, Hebrew, and Egyptian, consists of that number, and was so venerable among the Pythagorians, that they swore by it. Vul. Er. 206.
