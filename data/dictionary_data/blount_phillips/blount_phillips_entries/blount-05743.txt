Iulian Account, so called from Julius Caesar, who forty four years before the birth of Christ, observing the falseness of the Account then in use, ordained the year to consist of 365 days and six hours, which six hours in four years made 24 hours, or a day civil, and were added to the end of February; by reason whereof every fourth year contained 366 days, and was called Annus Bissextilis, the Bissextile or Leap-year, because the sixth of the Calends of March was twice written, and the thing it self was called Intercalation. This Account for many years seemed to have no sensible error; yet in progress of time it was discovered to be not so exactly agreeable with the natural motion of the Sun; For the Julian year exceeding the true Solar year 10 minutes & 48 seconds, caused the Equinoxes and Solstices yearly to change their places and slye back so many minutes and seconds. Whereupon Pope Gregory the thirteenth, by the advice and direction of Antonius Lilius and other excellent Mathematicians, in the year of Christ 1582, corrected the Calender, making the year to consist of 365 days, five hours, 49 min. 12 seconds. And that the vernal Equinox, which then was on the 11 of March, might be reduced to the 21 of March, as it was at the time of the first Nicene Council; he commanded ten days in Octob. viz. from the fourth to the 14, to be left out, so as the fourth day of the month was accounted for the 14 day. Hence it comes to pass, that the new, sorraign Lilian or Gregorian account is 10 days before the old, the English or Julian account. Buchol. Ind Chro. & al.
