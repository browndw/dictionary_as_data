Hoblers (hobellarii) In Ireland there were certain Knights so called, because they were wont to serve in the wars upon Hobbies; also with us certain persons who were by their tenure tyed to maintain a little light Nag (which in Ireland they call a Hobby, and hence we say a Hobbyhorse) for the certifying of any invasion made by Enemies, or such like peril towards the Sea side, as Portsmouth, &c. Of these you shall read A. 18. Ed. 3. Stat. 2. cap. 7. & An. 25. ejusdem Stat. 5. cap. 8. Antiq. Hiba cent rn. p. 35.
