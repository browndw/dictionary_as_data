Barristers or Baristers may be said to be of two sorts 1. The outward or AEtter Baristers, are such, as (for their long study and great industry bestowed upon the knowledge of the Common Law, which must be for seven years space at least) are called out of their contemplation to practice, and in the face of the world to take upon them the protection and defence of Clients causes. These always plead without the Bar, and are in other Countries called Licentiati in Jure, howbeit in modesty they at first continue themselves hearers for some years, like the Scholars of Pythagoras, that for the first five years never adventured to reason or discourse openly upon any point of their Masters Doctrine. 2. The Inner Baristers are those who are admitted (as a mark of respect) to plead within the Bar; such are King, Queen, or Princes Attorney, Sollicitor or Serjeants, or any of the Kings Council. But at the Rolls and some other inferior Judicatures, all Lawyers of the degree of the Bench are admitted within the Bar See Mootmen, and Apprentice.
