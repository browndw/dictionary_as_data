Paraphrase (paraphrasis) a free manner of exposition or interpretation, wherein a man ties not himself to express every word as it lies in the Copy, but to explicate and adorn the matter more at large, or to abridge it, yet stil keeping the Authors sence. Any such Exposition is called a Paraphrase or Paraphrastical Exposition.
