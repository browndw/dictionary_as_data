Pickadil (A Belg. Pickedillekens, i.e. Lacinia. Teut. Pickedel) the round hem, or the several divisions set together about the skirt of a Garment, or other thing; also a kind of stiff collar, made in fashion of a Band. That famous Ordinary near St James called Pickadilly, took denomination from this, that one Higgins a Taylor, who built it, got most of his Estate by Picadilles, which in the last age were much in fashion.
