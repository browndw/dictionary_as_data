Wisard or Wizard (perhaps from the Sax Witega, i. a Prophet or Foreteller of things to come) a cunning man, the Hebrews describe him thus; he put in his mouth the bone of a Beast named by them Jadua and burned Incense, and did other things, till he fell down with shame, and spake with his mouth, things that are to come. We commonly take him for a kinde of Witch, or one that can tell where things are, that were lost, &c.
