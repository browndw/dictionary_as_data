Winefrid, the name of an ancient Brittish Virgin Saint, of whom it is reported that after her head was cut off by Cradacus, there sprung up in the same place the Well, which at this day is called Saint Winefrids Well, and that Benno the Priest joyned her head again to her body; it is also the proper name of divers women, the word signifying in the Saxon tongue an obtainer of peace.
