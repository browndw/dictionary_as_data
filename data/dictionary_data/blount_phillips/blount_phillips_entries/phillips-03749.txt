Diomedes, the son of Tydeus, and Deiphile, and King of Aetolia, he was accounted one of the chiefest Hero's at the wars of Troy; he brought away Rhesus his horses and the Palladium, he wounded Mars and Venus, fought with Hector and Aeneas, whom his mother Venus protected; at length being ashamed to return home because of the whorish pranks of his wife Aegiale, he went into Apulia and had that Kingdom given him by Daunus. There was also another Diomed King of Thrace, who used to feed his horses with mans flesh; but at last Hercules overcoming him, gave him to be devoured by his own horses.
