St. Laurence, the name of a famous Martyr, who being a Deacon and Questor of the Roman church, and being commanded by Valerian the Prefect of the City to produce the Treasures of the Church which Sextus committed to his charge, he assembled together the poor, the lame, and the sick, and told the officers those were the Treasures of the Church; whereupon the Prefect thinking he was deluded, commanded he should be broiled upon a Gridiron, and Laurence as soon as he was almost ready to give up the ghost, said to the Prefect standing by, now turn me on the other side, this is broiled enough. This name is derived from the Latin word Laurus, i. a Laurel or Bay-tree.
