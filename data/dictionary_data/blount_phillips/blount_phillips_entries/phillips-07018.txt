Latonaa the daughter of Caeus, one of the Titans, she was got with child by Jupiter, which thing so incensed Juno, that she sent the Serpent Pytho to slay her; whereupon she fled to her sister Asteria, where she was delivered of twins, Apollo and Diana; but Diana being first brought forth, she immediately served her mother instead of a Midwife, and helped to bring her to bed of her brother Apollo, who as soon as he was come to age, killed the Serpent Pytho; Apollo and Diana being commonly taken for the Sun and Moon, are called Latonian Lights.
