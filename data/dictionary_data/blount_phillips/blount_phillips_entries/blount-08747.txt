Rebate, is a term most used among Merchants and Tradesmen: As when a Merchant sells Wares to a Shop-keeper for one hundred pounds, to be paid at six months end; if the Shop-keeper will at any time before the end of the six moneths, pay him the one hundred pounds, the Merchant commonly rebates for the time, that is, allows him so much as the interest of the 100 l. amounts to, for the time of such anti-payment. See Chamfering. And see Law of Conveyances, p. 206.
