Theano, the wife of Metapontus King of Icaria, she, wanting children of her own, brought up two twins the sons of Neptune and Menalippe the daughter of Desmontes; but afterwards bringing forth two sons of her own, which were likewise twins, and seeing her husbands affections inclining more to Menalippe's sons, than to her own, she was much troubled, and as soon as her sons came of age, she set them on to kill their supposed brethren; but Neptune their father coming to their aid, they killed the sons of Theano, which as soon as she came to hear, she killed her self.
