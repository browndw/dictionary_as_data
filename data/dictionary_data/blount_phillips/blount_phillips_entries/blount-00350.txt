Almanack (Hebr. Almanahh) a Prognostication or Kalender. But Verstegan derives it from the Germans; they used (says he) to engrave upon certain squared sticks about a foot in length, the courses of the Moons of the whole year, whereby they could always certainly tell when the New and Full Moons should happen, as also their Festival days; and such a carved stick they called an Al-mon-aght, that is to say, Al-mon heed, to wit, the regard or observation of all the Moons, and hence is derived the name Almanack. Verstegan p. 46, 47.
