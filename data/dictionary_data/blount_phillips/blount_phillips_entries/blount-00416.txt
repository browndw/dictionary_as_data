Amen (Heb. i.e. verA) in the end of prayer, wishing that it may be so, so be it. But when it is found twice repeated, as Amen, Amen, then it implies verily, verily, for confirmation of a truth, Mat. 18.3. Joh. 6.26. Durantus saith, that Amen imports, Be it to us which we have praied for. Amen is used in most languages; in Turky they use (Homin) instead of it. S.H.B.
