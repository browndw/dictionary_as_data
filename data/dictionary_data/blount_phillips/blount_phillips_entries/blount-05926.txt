Law of Marqua cent or Mart: This word is used 27. Ed. 3. Stat. 2. c. 17. and grows from the German word March. i. limes, a bound or limit. And the reason of this appellation is, because they that are driven to this Law of Reprizal, take the Goods of that people (of whom they have received wrong and can get no ordinary Justice) when they can catch them within their own Territories or Precincts. See Reprisal and Marque.
