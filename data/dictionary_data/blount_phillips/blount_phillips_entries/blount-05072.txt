Ianus was the God to whom the year was dedicated, and therefore it began with his festival, and the first moneth was nominated from him, for which cause he was represented with two faces, to shew he looked both backward on the time past, and forward on that to come, and sometimes with four faces; to signifie perhaps (for I know other reasons are given) the sour seasons of the year.
