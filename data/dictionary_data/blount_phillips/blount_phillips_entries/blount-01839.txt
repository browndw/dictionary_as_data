This Mountain was made habitable by Bellerophon, who is therefore feigned to have killed the Monster Chimaera. Hence Chimaera is metaphorically taken for a strange fancy, a castle in the air, an idle conceit. Chimaera was also the name of a ship, for so Virgil (l. 5. Aeneid.) calls one of the greatest ships of Aeneas.
