Lent (Sax.) The Spring-Fast; a time of fasting for forty days next before Easter; so called from Lenct-monaa cent , or length moneth, by which name the old Saxons called March, because then the days began first to exceed the nights in length: And they call this Fast, Lent, from the name of the said moneth, because the most part of it falls within the compass of this month.
