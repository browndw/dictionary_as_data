Hierarchy (hierarchia) an holy governance or principality. The Hierarchy or Holy Order of Angels contains (as some affirm) nine degrees, and is a mystical resemblance of the Blessed Trinity, there being in nine, thrice three, and in every three, thrice one. So that there are three superior, three inferior, and three middle degrees. The superior are Seraphins, Cherubins, and Thrones; the middle, Dominations, Principalities and Powers; the inferior, Vertues, Archangels, Angels. Bull.
