Pharisee, a Sect of Jews, professing more holiness then the common sort, they held contrary opinions to the Saduces, and wore Phylacteries, or Scroles of parchment bound about their heads, wherein were written the Ten Commandments, vainly so interpreting that of Deut. 6.8. Movebuntur super oculos tuos; they owe their name to the Hebr. phares or pharesk, i. seperare, explicare, as being both Interpreters of the Law, and Separatists (by their feigned devotion) from the rest of the Jewish Church. Mat. 5.20. Luk. 18.11. See Moses and Aaron p. 36, and 45.
