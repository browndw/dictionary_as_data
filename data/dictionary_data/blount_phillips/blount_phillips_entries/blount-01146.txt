The word is ordinary among the Feudists, and grown from them to other uses; as to that, which we here in England call a Proclamation, whereby any thing is publickly commanded or forbidden. But it is used more especially in publishing matrimonial contracts in the Church before marriage, to the end if any man can say any thing against the intention of the parties, either in respect of kindred, or otherwise, they may take their exception in time. Cow. But Mr. Sumner derives it from the Saxon Abannon. i. to publish. See his Sax. Dict. verbo. Abannon.
