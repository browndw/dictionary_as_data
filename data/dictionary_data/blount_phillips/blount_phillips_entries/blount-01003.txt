Attournment (from the Fr. tournA(C)r. i.e. to turn) is in our Common Law a yielding of the Tenant to a new Lord, or an acknowledgement of him to be his Lord (which we usually call to turn Tenant) for otherwise he that buyes or obtains any Lands or Tenements of another which are in the occupation of a third, cannot get possession; yet see the Stat. 27. H. 8. c. 16. The words used in attournment are set down in Littleton: I agree to the Grant made to you, &c. But the more common attournment is to say, Sir, I attourn to you by force of the same Grant: or, I become your Tenant, &c. or else deliver to the Grantee a penny, half penny or farthing by way of Attournment. Lit. l. 3. ca. Attournment. whom you may read more at large.
