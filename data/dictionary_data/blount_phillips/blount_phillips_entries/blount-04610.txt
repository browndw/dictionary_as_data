Gordian knot, is a knot which cannot be loosed: The phrase ariseth from this old story. Gordius (a King of Phrygia Major) being raised from the Plow to the Scepter, placed the furniture of his Wain and Oxen in the Temple of Apollo tied in such a knot, that the Monarchy of the world was promised to him that could untye it: which when Alexander had long tried, and could not do, he cut it with his sword.
