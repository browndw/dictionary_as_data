Appeal (Fr. appel) is often used in our Common Law as in the Civil: which is a removing of a cause from an inferior Judge to a superior, as Appeal to Rome, Ann. 24. H. 8. c. 12. and 1 Eliz. c. 1. So St. Paul appealed from Festus to Caesar. And it is also commonly used for the private accusation of a murtherer, by a person who had interest in the murthered party; or of any Felon, by one of his complices in the Fact. See more of this in Mr. Leighs Phil. Comm.
