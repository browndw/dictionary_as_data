Mulier, in Common Law, is a word taken contradistinct to a bastard, as if a man have a son by a woman before marriage, and then marrying the mother of that son who is called a bastard, have another son, this second son is called Mulier, and being compared together, they have this addition, Bastard eldest, and Mulier youngest; but the most proper signification of Mulier is a woman that hath had the company of man.
