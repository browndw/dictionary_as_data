Auspices (auspicia) were properly the observation of Birds, either by their singing and flying in the air, or by their gesture and manner of feeding in the Coop, whereby their Augurs and Pullarij pretended to know the will of the gods, whether they favored their enterprise or no. The Birds that gave sign by their voice and singing, they called Oscines, quasi ore canentes: Those that gave it by their flight and wings, were named Alites or Praepetes.
