Nilus, a River running through the midst of Aegypt and Aethiopia, counted the chiefest and the father of all other Rivers, and as some say, taketh its name from Nilus an ancient King of Aegypt. This River is famous for overflowing the Country every year, and making the soil fruitful, and for falling into the Sea within seven mouths in he figure of a Greek I.
