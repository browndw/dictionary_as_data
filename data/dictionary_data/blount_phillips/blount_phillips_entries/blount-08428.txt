Propraetor (Lat.) a Lieutenant appointed by the Emperor to govern a Province with the Authority of a Pretor, a Lord Justice. The Translator of Livie saith, tis more properly he, who having been Pretor, went out of his Magistracy at the years end, and was sent into his Province again, with full authority of Pretor.
