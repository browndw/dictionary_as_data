For the entrance of the young Student (who commonly comes from one of the the Universities) were first instituted and erected eight Houses of Chancery, to learn there the Elements of the Law; (viz.) Cliffords-Inn, Lions-Inn, Clements-Inn, Bernards-Inn, Staple-Inn, Furnivals-Inn, Davies-Inn, and New Inn; And each of these Houses consist of forty persons or more. For the Readers, Utter-Baristers, Mootmen, and inferior Students, there are four famous and renowned Colledges or Inns of Court; called. 1. The Inner Temple, to which the first three Houses of Chancery appertain; Grayes-Inn, to which the next two belong; Lincolns-Inn, which enjoys the last two saving one; and the Middle Temple, which hath onely the last. Each of these Houses of Court consist of Benchers above twenty, of AEtter Baristers above thrice so many, of Young Gentlemen about the number of 160 or 180, who there spend their time in study of Law, and commendable Exercises. The Judges of the Law and Sergeants, being commonly above the number of twenty, are equally distributed into two higher and more eminent Houses called Sergeants Inns. All these are not far distant one from another, and all together make the most famous University for profession of Law onely, or of any one human Science in the world, and advanceth it self above all others, Quantum inter viburna cupressus.
