Navigator (Lat.) a Sayler. We use to say, Sir Francis Drake was the first that sailed round the world, which may be true in a mitigated sence; viz. that he was the first Captain or person of note that atchieved this enterprize (Magellanus perishing in the midst of it) and therefore is reported to have given for his Devise a Globe with this Motto, Tu primus circumdedisti me. This Navigation was begun Ann. 1577. and in two years and a half with great vicissitude of fortune, finished.
