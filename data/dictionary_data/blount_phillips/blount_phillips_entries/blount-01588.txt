Carbuncle (carbunculus) has two significations, the one a precious stone, the other a dangerous botch or sore. Carbuncle stone, is bright, of the colour of fire, and has many vertues, but chiefly prevails against the danger of infectious air. Some call a Ruby in perfection a Carbuncle; others say a Diamond of a red or fiery colour, is a Carbuncle. Carbuncle disease is a botch, or ulcer, called otherwise by a Greek name Anthrax, caused of gross hot blood, which raiseth blisters, and burns the skin; This Ulcer is ever accompanied with a Feaver.
