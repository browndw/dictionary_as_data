Mahm or Maim (from the Lat. mancus) signifies a corporal hurt, whereby a man loseth the use of any member, that is or might be any defence to him in battle. The Canonists call it Membri mutilationem, as the Eye, the Hand, the Foot, the scalp of the Head, the fore tooth, or (as some say) any finger of the hand. Glanvile. lib. 14. ca. 7. And AEgolinus de irregularit. ca. 4. sect. 3, 4, 5.
