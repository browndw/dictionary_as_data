Piepowders Court or a Pourt of Pypoudre (from the Fr. pied, a foot, and pouldreux, dusty) is a Court held in Fairs for the redress of all disorders committed there; which because they are most frequented in Summer; the word was given of the dusty feet of the comers. Of this see Cromp. Juris. fol. 221.
