Iesutes, Those of the Society of Jesus, a Religious Order first founded by St. Ignatius Loyola, born in Biscay, in the year 1492. Pope Paul the third confirmed this Order, Sep. 15. 1540. To the three Vows of Poverty, Obedience, and Chastity, common to all other Orders, St. Ignatius at the institution hereof, added the Vow of Mission, which is this.a And further we judge it expedient for our greater devotion to the Sea Apostolique, and more full abnegation of our own wills and pleasures; that the professed of this Society, besides the common bond of the three Vows, be further tied by special Vow; so as that whatsoever the Roman Bishop for the time being shall command, pertaining to the salvation of souls, and propagation of the Faith, they shall be bound to execute, without tergiversation or excuse; whether they shall be sent unto Turks or Infidels, yea even unto those that are commonly called the Indians, or unto any other Hereticks or Schismaticks whatsoever.
