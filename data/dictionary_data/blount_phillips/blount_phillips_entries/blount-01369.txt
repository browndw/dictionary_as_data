Brachygraphy (brachygraphia) the Art of writing by short characters. I cannot say, either who was the Author, or whether the invention be antient or more modern, only I find in Dion, that Mecaenas (that great Favorite of Augustus Caesar, and favorer of learning) first sound out certain notes and figures ad celeritatem seribendi, for the speedier dispatch of writing.
