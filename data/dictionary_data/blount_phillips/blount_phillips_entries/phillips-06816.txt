Justices of tryal baston, or trayl baston, were certain Justices appointed by Edward the first to make inquisition through the Realme, upon all Officers, as Mayors, Sheriffs, Escheatours, &c. touching extortion, briberies, intrusion into other mens lands, and Barratours that used to take money for beating of men, and they had power either to punish by death, or to exact a ransome. This term comes from two French words, treille an arbour or form, and baston a staff or pole, to note that the Justices imployed in this commission, had authority to proceed without any solemn Judgement-seat, but wheresoever they could apprehend the malefactours.
