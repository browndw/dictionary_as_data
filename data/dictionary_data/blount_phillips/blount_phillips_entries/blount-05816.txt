Labyrinth (labyrinthus) a Maze or intricate building, or place made with so many turnings, and windings, entries and doors, that whoever went into it, could never get out, without a perfect guide, or a thread to direct him, the end of which thread must be tied at the door where he enters. Some heathen Princes bestowed infinite charge in building such Labyrinths, whereof there were four principal ones in the world. The first in Egypt, near the Pool Mirios, made for a Sepulchre for their Kings, or (as some write) in honor of the Sun. The second in the Island of Candy, built by Daedalus at the command of King Minos. The third, in the Isle Lemnos. The fourth in Italy, built by Porsenna King of the Hetrurians, of free-stone, and vaulted, for his own Sepulchre.
