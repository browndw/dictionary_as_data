Defender of the Faith. (Defensor Fidei) is a peculiar title given to the Kings of England by the Pope, as Catholicus to the King of Spain, and Christianissimus to the French King. It was first given by Leo decimus to King Henry the Eighth, for writing against Martin Luther, in behalf of the Church of Rome. The Bull for this Title bears date quinto Idus Octobr. 1521. and may be seen at length in the Lord Herberts Henry the Eighth, fol. 105. Stows Annals, p. 863.
