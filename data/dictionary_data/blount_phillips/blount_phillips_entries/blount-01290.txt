Bitume (bitumen) a kind of clay or slime naturally clammy, like pitch, growing in some Countries of Asia; It was of old used in Physick; the best is heavy, bright and clear, of purple colour, and having a strong smel; the black is accounted naught; this Bitumen was used instead of Mortar at building the Tower of Babel, as appears in Gen. 11. There is al a kind of Bitumen, like a liquor, flowing out of Mare Mortuum and out of some fountains in the Island Sicily, which is used instead of oyle to burn in Lamps.
