Administrator (Lat.) in our Common Law is properly taken for him that hath the goods of a man, dying intestate, committed to his charge by the Ordinary, and is accountable for the same, whenever it shall please the Ordinary to call him thereunto. An Administrator is by the Statute of 31. Edw. 3. cap 11. authorised to dispose of the goods of the deceased as fully, and to be accountable for the same, as Executors. Of Administrators and Executors, see a Treatise written by M. Wentworth of Lincolns Inn.
