Essenes or Esseans (aesseni vel aessei, so called from the Syriack a in non-Latin alphabet a, Asa, signifying to heal or cure diseases) were certain Sectaries or Philosophers, among the Hebrews of two sorts, the one Practicks the other Theoricks, both agreed in their Aphorisms, but in certain circumstances they differed. They referred every thing to Destiny, deemed the Soul to be mortal, would have men fight till death in defence of Justice, sacrificed not with the rest of the people, nor scarce conversed with them; were much given to tillage and husbandry, highly prizing purity of life and sanctity of conversation, they lived in common, never married, kept no servants, saying, Servants were wicked, and a Wife cause of discord. Their life was Monastick, and themselves given much to contemplation of the nature of Herbs, Plants, Stones, and Beasts: In diet, meat and drink, moderated by sufficiency, much addicted to Moral Philosophy, not caring for wealth, or hoarding up treasure. Josephus, and Moses and Aaron, p. 50.
