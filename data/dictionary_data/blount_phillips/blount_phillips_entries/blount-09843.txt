Spring-tides. As there are every day two Tides; so every moneth two courses of great Tides and small Tides; for seven days about the change of the Moon, are the great or Spring-tides, and the next ensuing seven days are the small or Neap-tides; then at Full Moon are the Spring-tides again, and all the last quarter Neap-tides; which course of the Sea is thus monethly renewed for ever; save that some extraordinary Spring-tides sometimes happen in the Spring and Autumn, and sometimes after plenty of Rain, or rage of Weather, &c, And in Neap tides the water is never so high, nor so low, as in Spring-tides.
