Medusa, the daughter of Phorcys, with whose golden hair Neptune was so much in love, that he lay with her in the Temple of Minerva, and begat Pegasus, at which the goddesse being incenced, turned her hairs into Serpents, whose sight converted all that look't on them into stone, but at length Perseus finding the Serpents asleep, killed them, and cut off Medusa's head.
