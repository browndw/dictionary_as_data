Normannia, or Normandy, a Countrey of Gallia Celtica; so called from the Normanni, a people anciently inhabiting Norwegia, who in the time of Charles the Grosse had this Countrey assigned them to dwell in, it being formerly called Neustria, and the people were all baptised with their Duke Rollo, whose name was changed into Robert.
