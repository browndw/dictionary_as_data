Acca Laurentia, the wife of Faustulus, Shepherd of Amulius King of the Latins, she took Romulus and Remus (the grandchildren of Numitor, whom his brother Amulius had expelled the Kingdom) and nursed them up secretly as her own, they being brought to her by her husband Faustulus, who found them sucking of a Wolf at the root of a Fig-tree from thence called Ruminalis, upon the banks of Tyber, into which they had been cast by the command of Amulius. Others say that the story of their being fostered by a Wolf ariseth from hence, namely that this woman from the gain she made by the prostitution of her body, was called Lupa, who dying very rich, had divine honours given her by the people of Rome, and festival dayes kept, which were called Laurentalia; and from her other name Lupa those houses of intertainment are called Lupanaria.
