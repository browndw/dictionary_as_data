Turneament or Tourneament, is a martial exercise of Knights or Souldiers combating one with another in disport on horseback, and is thus defined. Torneamenta dicuntur Nundinae vel feriae, in quibus milites ex condicto convenire & ad ostentationem virium suarum & audaciae, timerA congredi solent. The word is used in the Statute of 24 H. 8. cap. 13. And the reason of the name may proceed from the French (Tourner, i. vertere) because it consists much in agility both of horse and man. It was much in request with us in Queen Elizabetbs reign, being otherwise called Justing or Tilting.
