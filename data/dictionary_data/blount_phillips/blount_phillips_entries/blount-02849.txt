Denizen (from the Fr Donaison, i. Donatio, aut quasi Danes-son, i. Dani filius) is in our Common Law, an Alien enfranchised here in England by the Princes Charter, and inabled almost in all respects, to do as native Subjects do, namely, to purchase and possess Lands, to be capable of any Office or Dignity. Yet it is short of Naturalization, because a stranger naturalized, may inherit Lands by descent, which a man made onely a Denisen, cannot.
