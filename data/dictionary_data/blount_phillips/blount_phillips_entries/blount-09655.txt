Sir, a title of dignity given to Baronets and Knights; and not onely attributed to Kings, but to all Gentlemen in discourse; some derive it from the Hebr. sar, princeps, others from the Gr. a in non-Latin alphabet a, i. Dominus, others from the Brit. Syr or Syre, Domine; others from the Ital. Sere, or Fr. Sire. And Stephanus deduces it from Cyrus, the Persian word for a Lord or great Prince.
