London, the chief City of England, situate in Middlesex, so called as Cambden conjectureth, either from Lhun (which in the Brittish tongue signifieth a Grove) or Lhong, (i. a ship) and Dinas, i. a City, so that it may seem to have been anciently termed Lhundinas, i. a City thick of trees, or Lhongdinas, i. a City of Ships, from whence the Latins derive the word Londinum. It was called Augusta, and Troja Nova, being first founded by Brutus, who sprang of the Trojan race, and repaired by King Lud, and thence called Caerlud, or Luds-town.
