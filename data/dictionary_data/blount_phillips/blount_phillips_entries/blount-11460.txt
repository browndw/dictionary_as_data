Wassail or Wassale on Twelf-day at night, or on New-years Eve. The Origin in the words of Verstegan, thus. "Lady Rowena, Neece to Hengistus, having invited King Vortiger to a supper, at his new built Castle, called Thong-Castle, caused her after supper to come forth of her Chamber, into the Kings presence, with a Cup of gold filled with Wine in her hand and making, in very seemly manner, a low reverence to the King, said with a pleasing grace, in our antient Saxon Language, Waes heal ha cent aford Cyuing, which is, according to our present Speech, Be of health Lord King; for as (was) is our Verb of the preter-imperfect tence, signifying have been, so (Waes) being the same Verb in the Imperative Mood, and now pronounced (was) is as much to say, as, grow, be or become, and Waeshea cent l, by corruption of pronounciation afterwards became Wassaile. The King not understanding what she said, demanded it of his Chamberlain, who was his Interpreter, and when he knew what it was, he asked him, how he might answer her in her own Language; whereof being informed, he said unto her Drinc heal, i. Drink health, &c." Verst. p. 101. Some say tis Wassale, quasi, wash your throat with Ale.
