Incident (incidens, ab in & cado, a circumstance or by-matter, a thing which comes indirectly into a fact or question, or (being not properly of the substance thereof) arises from it collaterally or sideways; Also a chance, accident, casualty. Cotgr. In Law it signifies a thing necessarily depending upon another, as more principal. For example, a Court Baron is so incident to a Mannor, and a Court of Pie-powders to a Fair, that they cannot be severed by Grant: Or if a Mannor or Fair be granted, these Courts cannot be reserved. Kitch. fol. 36.
