Climacter (climactera) an account or reckoning made by degrees; the perillous time of mans life, at every seven or nine years end; Some have hereby divided the age of mans life in this manner; The seventh year they reckon dangerous, and by this account the 14, 21, 28, 35, &c. are climacterical years; likewise the ninth year is esteemed equally dangerous, and so the 18, 27, 36, &c. and 81 especially, which is nine times nine. But the most dangerous and climacterical year is, at the age of 63. because both accounts meet in this number, namely, seven times nine, and nine times seven.
