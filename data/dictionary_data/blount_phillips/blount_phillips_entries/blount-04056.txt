Family of Love, or Familism, a blasphemous Heresie broached by one Hen. Nicholas of Amsterdam about the year 1550. He maintained, that Christ is already come in his glory to judge, &c. And that the Seat or Throne of judgment whereon Christ sits, is the Community of the Family of Love, whereof the said H.N. is the eldest Father; and that he and they are Godded with God, and God manned with them, &c. These Familsts are now conceived to be turned into those we call Ranters.
