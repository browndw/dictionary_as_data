Megaclo, the daughter of Macares, King of the Lesbians, who being of a froward disposition, and alwayes contending with his wife, Megaclo was so grieved at her mothers calamity, that she hired the Muses to be her maids, and teaching them to sing, they by the sweetnesse of their Musick, so allayed the spirit of Megares, that his wife ever after lived a better life with him, for which benefite to her, she in thankfulnesse built pillars of brasse to their glory, and caused them to be honoured in all the Temples thereabout.
