Pledge (from the Fr. pleige) a surety or gage. To pledge one drinking, had its original thus; when the Danes bore sway in this Land, if a Native did drink, they would sometimes stab him with a Dagger or Knife; Hereupon people would not drink in company unless some one present would be their pledge or surety, that they should receive no hurt, whilst they were in their draught; Hence that usual phrase, Ile pledge you, or be a pledge for you. Others affirm the true sence of the word was, that if the party drunk unto was not disposed to drink himself, he would put another for a pledge to do it for him, else the party who began would take it ill.
