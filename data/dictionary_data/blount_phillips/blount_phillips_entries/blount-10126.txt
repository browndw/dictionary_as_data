Supererogation (supererogatio) laying out more then one hath received, or the doing more then a man is of necessity bound to do, a giving over-plus. In Divinity, works of Supererogation are usually taken to be such, as are done upon a pious account; and to which a man is not bound in particular by any positive precept of Gods Law.
