Nun (nonna q. non nupta. Teut. Nunn. Belg. Nonne) is a holy or consecrated Virgin, or a woman that by vow has bound her self to a single and chaste life, in some place and company of other women, separated from the world, and devoted to an especial service of God, by prayer, fasting and such like holy exercises.

Scholastica (the Sister of St. Benedict) was the first that collected them into companies, and prescribed them orders. Heyl.
