A Corbel, Corbet, or Corbil. In Masonry is a jutting or shouldering peece cut out in stone, as we may see in walls, to bear up a post, Summer or other weight, (which in Timber-work, is called a Bracket or Braggat.) This and such like terms of art, for the most part are taken from the similitude of Beasts, Birds, or some living thing, which they resemble, whence this is called Corbel (from the French Corbeau, a Crow or Raven) because they were wont to make such Jutties out of a wall in form of a Crow. Min. See Bragget.
