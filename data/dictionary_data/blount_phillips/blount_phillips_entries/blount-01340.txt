Boras or Borar, a white or greenish substance like Salt-petre, wherewith Gold-smiths use to soder gold and silver: some write it is the gum of a tree, which is very unlikely; others affirm it to be made of old Lees of Oyl, by art and drying in the Sun, brought to be white; but Dr. Bullokar rather conceives it to be a Mineral.
