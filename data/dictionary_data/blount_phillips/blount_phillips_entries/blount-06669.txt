Moloch or Molech (Heb.) a King or Prince. It was the name of an Idol, in the Valley of Gehinnom or Tophet, to which the Israelites abominably offered their children in sacrifice of fire. This Idol was represented by a man-like brazen body, bearing the head of a Calf. See more in Sir Wal. Ral. l. 2. fol. 294. and in Moses and Aaron, p 143.
