Tantalus, an ancient King of Phrygia, the son of Jupiter by the Nymph Plotis, he inviting the gods to a feast, killed his son Pelops, and set before them to eat, for which he was condemned to this punishment in Hell, namely to stand up to the chin in water, and to have pleasant apples hang over his head, and yet to be neither able to eat nor to drink, whence a man that is brought near to happinesse, and yet deprived of it, is commonly said to be Tantaliz'd.
