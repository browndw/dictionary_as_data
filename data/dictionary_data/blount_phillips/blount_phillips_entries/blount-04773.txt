Hayward alias Haward, seems to be compounded of two French words, haa cent t, i.e. sepes, a hedge, and (Garde, i. custodia) and signifies with us, one that keeps the common Herd of the Town; and the reason may be, because one part of his Office, is to look that they neither break nor crop the hedges of inclosed grounds. It may likewise come from the German word (Herd, i. armentum) and Bewarren, i. custodire;) he is a sworn Officer in the Lords Court, and the form of his oath you may see in Kitchin, fol. 46.
