Courteue of England (Lex Angliae) is used with us for a Tenure. For if a man marry an Inheritrix seized of Land in Fee-simple, or in Feetail general, or as Heir in Tail special, and gets a child of her, that comes alive into the world, though both it and his Wife die forthwith, yet if she were in possession, he shall keep the land during his life, and is called Tenant by the Curtesie of England. Glanvil. l. 7, ca. 18. Littleton l. 1. ca. 4.
