Estreat (from the Lat. Extractum, or from the Fr. Extraict) is used in our Common Law for the Copy or true note of an original writing. For example, of amerciaments or penalties set down in the Rolls of a Court, to be levied by the Bailiff or other Officer, of every man for his offence. See Fitz. nat. br fol. 75. H. 1. K. and 76. a. And so it is used Westm. 2. c. 8. & 13. Ed. 1.
