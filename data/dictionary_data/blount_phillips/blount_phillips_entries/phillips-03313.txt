Cycla cent ps, the sons of Neptune and Amphitrite, or as Apollodorus Atheniensis saith of Coelus and Terra, they were the servants of Vulcan, and made Thunder-bolts for Jupiter, having each of them one great eye in their forehead, their names were Bronte, Serope and Pyracmon, whom Apollodorus calleth Harpe, others say they were a very ancient people of Sicily of a very Gyantly stature.
