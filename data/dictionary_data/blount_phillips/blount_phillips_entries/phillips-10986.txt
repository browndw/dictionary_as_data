Stygian, (lat.) belonging to the River Styx, i. a Fountain near Nonacris in Arcaedia, whose waters are of a nature so vehemently cold, that nothing but the hooa cent of a Mule is able to contain them; the Poets fained it to be a River of Hell, and that the most solemne Oath, which the gods swore by, was by the waters of Styx.
