Thymaetes, a Trojan, who marrying Arisbe the daughter of Priamus, had a son born on the same day with Paris, and because the Augurs had foretold that one born that day should be the destruction of Troy, Priamus commanded that both the children should be slain; but Paris being saved by his mother, Thymaetes son was onely killed, for which he bearing a revenge in his mind, was the first that caused the Trojan horse to be let in.
