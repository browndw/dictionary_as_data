Honor, does sometimes signifie the most noble sort of Seigniories, on which other inferior Lordships or Mannors depend by performance of some Customs or Services to the Lords of such Honors. And it seems there are no Honors, but such as did originally belong to the King, and have since been given in Fee to Noble men. Of this sort are the Honors of Windsor, Greenwich, Tickhil, &c. And Courts there held are called Honor-Courts. 37 H. 8.18.33 H. 8.37.
