Adamites (Adamiani) a Sect of Hereticks begun in Bohemia about two hundred years since, by Adamus Pastor an ignorant fellow, who pretended, forsooth, to raise a sort of sanctified people, but indeed it was rather an herd of shameless beasts; one proper mark of their profession was, to meet stark naked in their Synagogues, which were sometimes hot Stoves, and none were to be admitted into their number, but such as could stand stark naked before the rest of their company, men and women, for the space of an hour, without shame or blushing; they held sundry heretical Doctrines, as that in Christ there was but one Nature, &c. There were in the third age after Christ, some that gave beginning to such a Sect, but failing of acceptance, it dyed, or lay as it were raked up in Embers till the forenamed Adamus blew this cole in Bohemia, and afterwards about the year 1535 in Holland, chiefly at Amsterdam, AEtricht, and Emden, in which and many other places they are still conceived to be lurking.
