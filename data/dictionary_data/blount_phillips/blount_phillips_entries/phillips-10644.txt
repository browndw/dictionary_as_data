Shaftsbury, a Town in Dorcetshire, so called from the Churches spire-steeple, such as they anciently termed Scheafts, in Latin Septonia. This place is famous for Aquila (some say a reall Eagle, others a Prophet so called) who foretold that the Brittish Empire, after the Saxons and the Normans should return again to the ancient Brittains.
