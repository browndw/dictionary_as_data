Tuysco was the most antient and peculiar Idol-god of all the old Germans, from whence they called themselves Tuya cent hen, that is, Duytshes or Duytsh-people; and the day which yet among us retains the name of (Tua cent sday) was especially dedicated to this Idol. See its posture in Verstegan, pag. 57.
