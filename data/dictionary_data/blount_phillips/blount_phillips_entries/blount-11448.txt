Waif or Weif. The nineteenth Chapter of the Grand Customary of Normandy, is entituled (De choses gaives) and Latined by the interpreter, De rebus vaivis, i. Of things waived, which are there thus defined. Vaiva sunt res, velalia, quae nullius proprietate attributa, sine possessionis reclamatione sunt inventa, quae usque ad Diem & annum servanda sunt. This weif or things weived, are nothing but things forsaken. The Civilians call it Derelictum. Bract. (lib. 1. cap. 12. num. 10.) reckons them inter res, quae sunt nullius, ea quae pro waivio habentur; sicut de averiis, ubi non apparet dominus; where he also saith, Quod olim fuerunt inventoris dA jure naturali, & jam efficiuntur Principis de jure gentium. This is a Regality, and belongs to the King, except it be challenged by the owner within a year and a day, as appears by Britton, cap. 17. Now the Kings in their times have granted this, and such like Prerogatives to Subjects within their Liberties and Fees; so that Waifs, Estrays, Things lost, are the Lords of the Franchise, where they are found, but must first be cried and published in Markets and Churches near about, or else the year and day runs not to the prejudice of him that lost them; and otherwise the Detainer may be accus'd of Theft.
