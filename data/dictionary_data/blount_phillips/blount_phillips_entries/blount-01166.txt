Barettor or Barrator (Fr. Barateur, i. a deceiver) in our Common Law, is a common wrangler, that sets men at odds, and is himself never quiet, but at variance with one or other: but Skene (de verh. signif. verbo Barratry) saith Barraters are Symonists, and so called from the Italian (barrataria) signifying corruption or bribery in a Judge giving a false Sentence for money.
