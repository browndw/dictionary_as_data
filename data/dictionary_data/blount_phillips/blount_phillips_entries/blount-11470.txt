Weights (pondera) there are two sorts of them in use with us; the one called Troy weight, which has Twelve ounces in the pound, and by this, Pearl, precious Stones, Electuaries, or Medicinal things, Gold, Silver and Bread are weighed; the other Avoir-du-pois, which contains sixteen ounces in the pound; by this all other things are weighed that pass between man and man by weight, saving onely those above named: Why the one should be cal'd Troy weight I have not learned; though I read it libram & unciam Trojanam, as if it came from Troy: The other seems to be so termed by reason of the more full weight; for Avoir du pois in French, is to have good weight, but by these words Avoir du pois are somtimes signified such merchandize as are bought and sold by this kind of weight. Fleta l. 2. c. 12. saith, 15 ounces make the merchants pound; which 'tis like, though an ounce less, should be all one in signification with the pound Avoir-du-pois, and the other Pound, called by Fleta, Trone weight, plainly appears to be all one with that, which we cal Troy weight; and I find not Troy weight mentioned by any other that ever I read upon this subject, but onely our own Countrimen. See Tronage. One Phidon an Argive is said to have bin the first finder out of VVeights and Measures. See Ounce & Sarplar.
