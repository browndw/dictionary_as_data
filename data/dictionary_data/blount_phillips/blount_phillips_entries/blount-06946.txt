Nicholaitans (so called from Nicholas, the Proselyte of Antioch, one of the seven Deacons, which were instituted with Saint Stephen by the Apostles) a sort of Hereticks that held it lawful to have their wives common, &c. St. John makes mention of them in his Apocalypse, where (speaking of the Church of Pergamus) he saith, Thou hast them that hold the doctrine of the Nicholaitans.
