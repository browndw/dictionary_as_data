Tranfiguration (transfiguratio) a turning out of one shape into another, a transforming. The tranfiguration of our Saviour Christ doth not signifie the turning or change of one figure or one shape into another, but as it were a putting on an exceeding splendor and brightness that made his blessed face shine as the Sun, and his cloaths white as snow.
