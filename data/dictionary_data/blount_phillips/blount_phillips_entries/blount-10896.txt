Tuscan-work; In Architecture there are five orders of Pillars, The Tuscan Dorique, Jonique, Corinthian, Composite or Italian. See Sir Hen. Wottons Elements of Architecture, pag. 206, and 209. The Tuscan is a plain, massie, rural Pillar, resembling some sturdy, wel-limb'd laborer, homely clad; the length of it ought to be six Diameters of the grossest of the Pillars below.
