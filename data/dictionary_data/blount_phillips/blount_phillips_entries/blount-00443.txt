Amphictious (Amphyctiones) were the most noble Counsellors of Greece, selected out of the twelve prime Cities, and instituted either by Acrisius (as Strabo) or (as Halicarnassaeus thinks) by Amphictyon the son of Helen, from whom they seem to have derived their name: They had power to decide all controversies, and to enact Laws for the common good; their meetings were at the beginning of the Spring and Autumn.
