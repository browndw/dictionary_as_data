Parliament or Parlement (Fr. q. Parler le ment) or Parlament, from the Italian and Spanish Parlamento. With us it was antiently the Assembly of the King, and the three Estates of the Realm, viz. The Lords Spiritual, Temporal, and Commons, for debating matters touching the Commonwealth, and especially the making and correcting Laws; which Assembly or Court is of all other the highest, and of greatest authority, as you may read in Sir Tho. Smith, de Republ. Angl. l. 2. c. 1, 2. In France, those high Courts of Justice where mens causes and differences are publickly determined, without further Appeal, whereof there be eight, in eight capital Cities, viz. Paris, Grenoble, Tholose, Dyon, Roven, Aix, Rhemes, and Bourdeaux) are called Sedentary Parliaments; and their Assembly of States General is onely equivalent to our Parliament.
