Commissary (commissarius) a title of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, ordained to this special end, to supply the Bishops jurisdiction and Office in the out-places of the Diocess, or else in such Parishes as were peculiar to the Bishop, and exempted from the jurisdiction of the Arch-Deacon; for where either by prescription or composition, there are Arch-Deacons, that have jurisdiction within their Arch-Deaconries, as in most places they have, there this Commissary is but superfluous.
