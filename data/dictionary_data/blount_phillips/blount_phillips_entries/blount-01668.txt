Catharians, were a branch of the Novatian Hereticks that lived in the third age after Christ. They took the name Cathari from the Greek word a in non-Latin alphabet a (which signifies clean or pure) by reason of the cleanness and purity they challenged to themselves, saying, they were altogether pure from sin, and therefore omitted that clause in the Lords Prayer, Forgive us our Trespasses, as we forgive, &c. they denied original sin, and the necessity of Baptism, with other Heretical doctrines.
