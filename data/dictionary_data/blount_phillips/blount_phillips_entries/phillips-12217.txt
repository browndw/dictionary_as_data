Zenobia, called also Zebennia, a Queen of Palmyrene, and the wife of Odatus, she governed the Roman Provinces in Syria, being reckoned among the 30 Tyrants who usurpt the government of the World in the time of Galenus; she was at length overcome by the Emperour Aurelian, and led in Triumph through the City of Rome with Golden Chains: Yet he in compassion afterwards gave her a possession in Tybur. She understood the Aegyptian, Greek, and Roman Languages, and brought up her sons Herennianus and Timolaus in learning, of whom it is not known what became, whether they died a natural death or were killed by Aurelian.
