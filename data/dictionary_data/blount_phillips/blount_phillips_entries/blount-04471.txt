Gaudy or Grand days. In the Inns of Court there are four of these in the year, that is, one in every Term, viz. Ascention day in Easter Term, Midsummer day in Trinity Term, All Saints day in Michaelmas Term, and Candlemas day in Hillary Term; these four are no days in Court, and on these days double Commons are allowed, and Musick on all Saints, and Candlemas day, as the first and last of Christmas. The Etymology of the word may be taken from Judge Gawdy, who (as some affirm) was the first institutor of those days, or rather from gaudium, because (to say truth) they are days of joy, as bringing good cheer to the hungry Students. In Colledges they are most commonly called Gaudy, in Inns of Court Grand days, and at Court they were called Coller days. See Coller days.
