Subpaena, is a Writ that lies to call a man into the Chancery, to have equity upon such case only as the Common Law hath not provided for; There is also a Subpaena ad testificandum, which lies for calling in witnesses to testifie in a Cause, as well in Chancery, as in other Courts; And the name proceeds from words in the Writ, which charge the party called to appear at the day and place assigned, sub paena centum librarum, &c. But in case the party to appear, be a Lord of Parliament, or the Widow of such Lord, then is he or she called by the Lord Keeper or Lord Chancellors Letter, giving them notice of the suit intended against them, and desiring them to appear. Cromp. Juris. fol. 33.
