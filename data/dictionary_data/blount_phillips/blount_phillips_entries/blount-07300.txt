Ordinary (ordinarius) though in the Civil Law, whence the word is taken, it signifies any Judge that has authority to take knowledge of Causes in his own right; as he is a Magistrate and not by deputation, yet in our Common Law it is most commonly and usually taken for him that hath ordinary Jurisdiction in causes Ecclesiastical. See Brook and Linwood hoc titulo.
