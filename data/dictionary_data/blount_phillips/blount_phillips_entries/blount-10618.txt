Tobaco or Tobacco (sic vocatur in omnibus linguis) a Drug too well known in England since the year 1585 when the Mariners of Sir Fra. Drake first brought it hither from the Indies, where some affirm there is an Island called Tobacco, and abounding with it, whence the Drug took denomination, if nor, the Island so called from the Drug.
