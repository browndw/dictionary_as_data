Libethra, a Town seated upon the mountain Olympus, of which it was foretold by the Oracle, that all the inhabitants should be destroyed by a Sow, when the Sun should behold Orpheus his bones, which was thus verified; A great multitude of people being gathered together to hear a Shepherd sing in the way which leadeth from Dion to Olympus, a large Urn containing Orpheus his bones, which stood in that place, was overturned and his bones laid open to view, and the very same day, a great violent stream called Sys (which in Greek signifieth a Sow) overflowing, destroyed the whole Town with all the people in it. Libethra is also the name of a Fountain of Magnesia, sacred to the Muses who are thence called Libethrides.
