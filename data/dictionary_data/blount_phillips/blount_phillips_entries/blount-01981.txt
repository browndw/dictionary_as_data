Servius Tullius caused a general valuation of every Citizens estate throughout Rome, to be taken upon record, with their age; and according to their estates and age, he divided the Romans into six great Armies or Bands which he called Classes; The valuation of those in the first Classe, was not under two hundred pounds, and they alone by way of excellency, were termed Classici: And hence figuratively, are our best, and most approved authors, viz. such as are of good credit and authority in the Schools, termed Classici Scriptores, Classical Authors.
