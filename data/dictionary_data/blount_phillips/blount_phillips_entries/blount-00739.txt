Arbitratour (arbitrator) is an extraordinary Judge or Commissioner in one or more causes, between party and party, chosen by their mutual consents. This Arbitrement is either general, that is, including all Actions, Quarrels, Executions and Demands; or special, which is of one or more matters, facts, or things specified. The Civilians (says Dr. Cowel) make a diffetence between Arbiter and Arbitrator; For though they both ground their power upon the comprimize of the parties, yet their liberty is divers. For Arbiter is tyed to proceed and judge according to Law, with equity mingled: Arbitrator is permitted wholly to his own discretion, without solemnity of process, or course of judgement, to hear or determine the controversie committed to him, so it be juxta arbitrium boni viri.
