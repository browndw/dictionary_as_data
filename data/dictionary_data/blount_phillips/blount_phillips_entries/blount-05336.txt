Incubus (Lat.) A Devil that sometimes in mans shape lies with women, as Succubus doth with men. Also a disease called the Night-Mare, when a man in his sleep supposes he has a great weight lying on him, and feels himself almost strangled; in such sort that he cannot turn himself, nor sit up, nor call for help. The vulgar think it some spirit, but Physitians affirm it to be a natural disease, caused by humors undigested in the stomack, which fuming up to the brain, do there trouble the Animal spirits, stopping their passage into the sinews, so that the body cannot move. Bull.
