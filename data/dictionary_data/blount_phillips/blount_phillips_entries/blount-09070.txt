Rogation week (Sax. Gangdagas, i. days of perambulation) is always the next but one before Whitsonday; and so called, because on Munday, Tuesday and Wednesday of that week, Rogations and Litanies were used; and fasting, or at least abstinence, then enjoyned by the Church to all persons, not onely for a preparative to the joyful remembrance of Christs glorious Ascension, and the Descention of the Holy Ghost in form of Cloven Tongues shortly after; but also to request and supplicate the blessing of God upon the Fruits of the Earth. And in this respect the solemnization of Matrimony is forbidden from the first day of the said week, till Trinity Sunday. The Belgians call it Cruys-week, i. Cross-week, and so is it called in some parts of England because of old (as still among Roman Catholiques) when the Priests went on Procession this week, the Cross was carried before them. The first institution of this weeks solemnities, is by Historians referred to Claudius Mamertus, Bishop of Vienne in France.
