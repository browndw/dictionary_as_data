Gymnosophists (gymnosophistae, from gymnos, naked, and sophos, wisdom) certain Philosophers in India that went always naked, and lived solitary in woods and desarts, feeding on herbs, the first beginner of which Sect was (as St. Hierome reports, Cont. Jovinian.) called Buddus. These Gymnosophists were to the Indians, as the Druides to the Brittans, and are by them called Brachmans. See Brachmans. Strabo says there were two kind of Gymnosophists, one dwelling in Desarts, &c. termed Hermanes; The other frequented Kings Courts, Cities, &c. and were called Brachmans.
