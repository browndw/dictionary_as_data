Gyges Ring; Gyges was King of Lydia, and his Ring said to have this property, that being on the finger, and turned to the inside of the hand, the wearer went invisible; but turning it to the outside, then he was visible again, as before. Plat. in lib. de Repub. will tell you how Gyges came by this Ring.
