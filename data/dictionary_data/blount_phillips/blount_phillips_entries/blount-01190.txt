Beatitude (beatitudo) blessedness, happiness, prosperity. The eight Beatitudes are abstractedly thus; 1. To be poor of spirit. 2. Meek. 3. Mourn. 4. To hunger and thirst after Justice. 5. To be Merciful. 6 Clean of heart 7. Peace-makers. 8. To suffer persecution for Justice. Which see at large in St. Matth cap. 5. They are called Beatitudes, because the Scripture says, Beati qui, &c. they are blessed that are in any of those states.
