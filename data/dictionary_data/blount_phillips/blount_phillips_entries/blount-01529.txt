Canon. (Gr.) Properly a Rule or line to make any thing straight, or to try the straightness of it. Hence Laws or Decrees for Church-Government are called Canons; and certain times of Prayer used by Church-men are called Canonical hours of Prayer, as Matins, Laudes, &c. And we call those Canonical books, which are authentical Scripture.
