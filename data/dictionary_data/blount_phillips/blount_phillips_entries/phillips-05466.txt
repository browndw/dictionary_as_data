Gule of August, the first day of August, otherwise called Lammas day, in old Almanacks St. Peter ad Vincula, it cometh from the French word Gueul, i. e. a throat, because on that day, a certain maid having a disease in her throat, was cured by kissing the Chains, that St. Peter had been bound with at Rome.
