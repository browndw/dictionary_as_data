Sesterce Sesterca cent e (sestertius) a coyn among the Romans, whereof Denarius contained four, and is so called quasi Semitertius, for it contained two and a half of the brazen coin called As, and it is marked with this figure, H-S. which signifies two pound and a half. Of our money it valued about three half pence farthing; Or (as the Translator of a cent Tacitus computes it) three half pence farthing, and half farthing. This Character H-S. two capital II. and the letter S thus coupled together, stood for Sestertius, others say the true character was L L.S.
