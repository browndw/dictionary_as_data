Feofment (from the Gottish word feudum, and signifies Donationem feudi) is in our Common Law any gift or grant of any Honors, Castles, Manors, Messuages, Lands or other corporal & immoveable things of like nature, to another in Fee-simple, by the delivery of seism, and possession of the thing given, whether the gift be made by word or writing; and when it is in writing it is called a Deed of Feofment, and in every Feofment the giver is called the Feoffer, and he that receives by vertue thereof, the Feoffee; And Littleton says, that the proper difference between a Feoffer and Donor, is, that the Feoffer gives in Fee-simple, and the Donor in Fee-tayl.
