Feid, Feed or Feud, Is that ill custom which hath been much used in Scotland, and the North of England, viz. a combination of kindred, to revenge the death of any of their blood against the killer, and all his race. These deadly Feids, King James in his Basilicon Doron, advised his son to redress with all care possible. The word signifies hatred. See Feud.
