Supersedeas (from supersedeo, i. to omit, leave off or cease) is a Writ which lies in divers cases, and signifies a command or request to stay or forbear the doing of that, which in appearance of Law were to be done, were it not for the cause whereupon this Writ is granted; for example, a man regularly is to have Surety of Peace against him, of whom he will swear he is afraid, and the Justice required hereunto cannot deny him; yet if the party be formerly bound to the Peace, either in Chancery, or elswhere, this Writ lieth to stay the Justice from doing that which otherwise he might not deny.
