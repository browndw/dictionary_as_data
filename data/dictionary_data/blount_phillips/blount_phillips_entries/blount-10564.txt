Thor was an Idol of great esteem among the old Saxons and Teutonicks, and the day now called Thursday was dedicated to his peculiar service, and thence took denomination, which the Danes and Swedes yet call Chorsa cent ay; He was also called the God of thunder, whence in the Neatherlands the day is called Dundersdagh, or Chuna cent ersday. Versteg. 60, 61.
