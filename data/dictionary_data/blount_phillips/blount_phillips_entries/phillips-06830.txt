Ixion, the son of Phlegyas, he having slain his son in law Erioneus, after he had long wandered up and down, and could not be absolved either by gods or men; at length Jupiter pitying him, took him up into Heaven and expiated him; but he after his purgation remaining among the gods, fell in love with Juno and sollicited her to unchastity, which she making known to Jove, he formed a cloud in the shape of Juno, and Ixion thinking it to have been the goddesse, begat a race of Centaurs, and being soon after sent down to the earth, he boasted every where that he lay with Juno, for which being struck down to Hell with a Thunderbolt, he was condemned to be alwayes rowled on a wheele.
