Waif, or Waive, the same which the Civilians call derelictum, any thing (whether it be Cattel strayed, or goods stolen and quitted upon Hue and Cry) which being found are to be proclaimed sundry Market dayes, and if they challenge them within a year and a day are to be restored, otherwise they are to belong to the Lord of the Franchise; also as a man forsaken of the Law, to which he was sworn is said out-lawed, so a woman not being sworn to the Law is called Waive.
