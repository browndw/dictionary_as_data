Abate (from the Fr. Abatrea i. to break down or destroy) signifies, in its vulgar sence, to diminish or take away; as to abate the courage of a man; so one that abateth in Lands and Tenements, by his entry diminishes and takes away the freehold in Law descended to the Heir. In another sence it signifies to beat down or overthrow, as to abate Castles, Houses and the like; and to abate a Writ, is to destroy it for a time through want of good ground or other defect: And hence comes Abatement, which in our Common Law, is an entry into Land by interposition of one that has no right after the death of the Ancestor, and before the entry of the Heir.
