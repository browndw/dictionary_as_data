Collateral (collateralis) not direct, on the one side, joyning to, or coming from the same side. Every degree of kindred, is either right lineal, or Collateral. The right lineal is that which comes from the Grandfather to the Father, from the Father to the Son, and so still right downward. Collateral is that which comes side-ways, as first between Brothers and Sisters, then between their Children, &c. Also Uncles, Aunts, and all Cousens are contained under this term Collateral kindred.
