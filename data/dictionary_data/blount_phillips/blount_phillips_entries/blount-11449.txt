The Expositor of Law Terms also saith, VVaif is when a Thief has feloniously stoln Goods, and being closely pursued with Hue and Cry, or else overcharged with the burden or trouble of them, for his ease or more speed, flies away, and leaves the goods, or any part of them behind him; then the Kings Officers, or the Reeve or Bailiff of the Lord of the Manor, who has such Franchise of VVaif, may seize the Goods, so waived, to the Lords use, who may keep them as his own proper, except the owner come with fresh Sute after the Felon, and sue an Appeal, or give in Evidence against him at his Arraignment upon the Indictment, and he be attainted thereof, &c. In which cases the first owner shall have restitution of his Goods so stoln and waived. Also if a man be pursued with Hue and Cry, as a Felon, and leaves his own Goods, &c. these shall be taken as Goods waived and forfeited, as if they had been stoln.
