Critical or Judicial days (dies critici) are when the disease comes to the Crisis or judgement of amending or impairing, and they are the fourth and seventh days; because in them the Physitians use to judge of the danger of a disease: But the seventh is accounted the chief Critical day, and the fourth a token or sign, what the seventh day will be, if the Patient live so long. This account must be made according to the number of weeks thus; In the first week the fourth day is the token or Critical of the seventh day. In the second week the eleventh is the critical of the fourteenth. In the third, the seventeenth is the critical of the twentieth, (for Hippocrates reckons the twentieth day for the last of the third week.) In the fourth, the twenty fourth is the critical of the twenty seventh; and so forth to an hundred. Bull.
