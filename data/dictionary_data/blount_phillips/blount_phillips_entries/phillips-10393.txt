Saturnals, (lat.) Feasts dedicated to Saturn, an ancient heathen deity, the son of Coelus and Vesta, who married his sister Ops and cut off the genital members of his father Coelus, and threw them into the Sea, out of the froth of which sprung Venus, from thence called Aphrodite, he sought to devour all his male children, wherefore Ops as soon as she was delivered of Jupiter, and Juno at a birth, she gave him instead of Jupiter a great stone wrapt up in swadling-clouts, which he devoured; next she brought forth Neptune, whom she concealed, as also Pluto and Glaucus whom she had at a birth; He was overthrown by his brother Titan who made war against him for the Kingdom, and shut up him and his wife in prison, whence he was delivered by his son Jupiter, against whom also making war himself, he was driven out of his Kingdom, and fled into Italy to Janus whom he taught Husbandry and the use of the Vine. Saturn is also the name of one of the 7 Planets, the slowest in motion and of the melancholiest influence; also among Chymists it is taken for lead.
