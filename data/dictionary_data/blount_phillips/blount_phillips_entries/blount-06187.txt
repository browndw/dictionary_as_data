Lustium (Lat.) a Den or Cave for wilde beasts; a purging by Sacrifice; also the space of fifty moneths, or five years The Romans sometimes kept their account of time by these Lustiums, which were so called because they did once in every five years revolution, Lustrare exercitum Romanum, by sacrifice purge the Roman Army. Hence we use sometimes, two Lustrums, for ten years, three Lustrums fifteen years, &c.
