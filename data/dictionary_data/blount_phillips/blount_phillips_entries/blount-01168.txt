Barriers (from the Fr. Barres) signifies with us that which the Fr. call (jeu de Barres, i. palaestram) a martial sport or exercise of men armed and fighting together with short swords, within certain limits or Lists, whereby they are severed from the beholders. This exercise was formerly much in request in England, but now is laid aside.
