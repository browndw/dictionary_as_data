Phalanx, (Greek) a Military squadron consisting of 8000 men, most in use among the Macedonians; some think it was first invented by Phalanx, and from him so called; he was the brother of Arachne, and was instructed in Military discipline by Pallas, and taught his sister the use of the needle, but afterwards lying with his sister, they were both turned into vipers by Pallas.
