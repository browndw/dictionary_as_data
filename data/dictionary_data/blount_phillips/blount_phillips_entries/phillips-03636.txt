Deucalion, the son of Prometheus, he with his wife Pyrrha the daughter of Epimetheus, were saved in the universal Deluge, being carried in a ship to the top of Pernassus and consulting the Oracle of Themis what way they should take to restore mankind, and being told they should throw the bones of their first mother behind them, they took stones out of the earth, and cast them behind them. Those which Deucalion cast became men, and those whic Pyrrha cast became women.
