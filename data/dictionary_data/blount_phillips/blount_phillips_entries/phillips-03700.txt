Dido, the daughter of Belus, King of the Tyrians, she was married to Sichaeus Priest of Hercules, whom Pygmalion slew that he might obtain his riches; but she gathering all the wealth she could together, fled into Africa, and there built a City which was first called Byrsa, afterwards Carthage, and refusing to marry Iarbas King of Getulia, because he went about to force her by war, she killed her self. Others say, it was because falling in love with Aeneas who was driven by tempest on her coast, he refused to marry her.
