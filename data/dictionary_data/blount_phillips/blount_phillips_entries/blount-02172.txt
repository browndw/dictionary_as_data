Coma cent r (from the Lat. compar) signifies a fellow, an equal, a consort, a fellow in Peerage. But taken from the Latin Compater, it is a word by which the Father of a child calls the Gossips, Witnesses, or Godfathers of his child, and it may be read in significations somewhat different from these expressed. In the Isle of Zacynthus or Zant they have a custom at Weddings to invite many young men, whom they call Compeers, of which every one gives the Bride a Ring; which done, it is there held an abuse as detestable as Incest, to accompany her in any carnal kind: wherefore they chuse such for Compeers, as have formerly been suspected of too much familiarity.
