Stonehenge, a wonderfull Pile of stones upon Salisbury plain, erected within the Circuit of a Ditch, in manner of a Crown in three ranks, one within another, whereof some are 28 foot high, and seven foot broad, upon the heads of which others lie overthwart with Mortises; so as the whole frame seemeth to hang; it is termed by the old Historians Chorea Gigantum, i. the Gyants dance.
