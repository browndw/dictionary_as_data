Critical, (Greek) of a nice judgement, apt to censure. Also Critical dayes in a disease, are those dayes wherein a disease comes to its Crisis, and they are the odde dayes as the third, fifth, seventh, and so on; but the most critical are counted the fourteenth. The Crisis in acute diseases is judged by the Moon, but in Chronick diseases, the Crisis is judged by the Sun
