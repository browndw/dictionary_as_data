Horizon (Gr.) a Circle immoveable, dividing the half-Sphear of the Firmament which we see, from the other half we see not; it hath the name of a in non-Latin alphabet a, i. termino, to bound or limit, because it limits our sight. For example, imagine you stood upon Highgate or the Tower-hill at Greenwich, so far as you may see round about, as in a Circle, where the Heaven seems to touch the earth, that is called the Horizon; the Poles whereof are, the point just over your head, called Zenith in Arabick; and the other under your feet, passing by the Center of the world, called Nadir. The Sun rising and going down is ever in this Line or Circle. Peach.
