A Collection, (lat.) a gathering or levie. Collection is when two principal significates do not behold one another, but both of them cast several aspects to a more weighty Planet than themselves, and they both receive him in some of their essential dignities, then shall the Planet which thus collects both their lights, bring the thing demanded to perfection.
