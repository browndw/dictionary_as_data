Piazza cent (Ital.) a Market-place or chief street; such is that in Covent-Garden, which the vulgar corruptly call the P.H, The close Walks are not o properly the Piazza, as the ground inclosed within the Rail. Note, when two z's happen together in Italian, the first is pronounced as t; so we truly pronounce it Piatza.
