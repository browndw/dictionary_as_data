Lotophagi, a certain people of Africa, dwelling near the Syrtes, so called because they feed much upon the Lote-tree, which is a tree of that nature, that when the companions of Vlisses being cast upon the coast of Africa had tasted of the fruit of it, they could hardly be got from thence to return into their own Country, whence the word is proverbially used for those that are forgetful of their Parents, Country and Kindred.
