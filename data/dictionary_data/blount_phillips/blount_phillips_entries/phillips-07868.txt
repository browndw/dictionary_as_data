Minos, a King of Creet the son of Jupiter, (or as some say, of Xanthus) and Europa, he having great wars with the Athenians and Megareans, because they slew his son Androgeus, had Megara delivered to him by the treachery of Scylla; he intertained Daedalus an Athenian being banisht from his Country, who being an excellent Artist, made that famous Labyrinth into which the Minotaur was put; But afterwards for making a wooden Heifer into which Pasiphae the wife of Minos being included, received the Bull again, by which she had formerly had the Minotaur, he was shut up into the Labyrinth himself, together with his son Icarus; but he making waxen wings for himself and his son, fled away into Sicily, where he was stifled in a Bath by the daughter of King Crocalus, his son having melted his wings by the way, and fallen into the Sea, which was thence called the Icarian Sea.
