Convocation (convocatio) a calling or assembling together, most commonly of Ecclesiastical persons for Church affairs. A Synod and a Convocation seem to be all one; before the Statute of Premunire (16. Ric. 2. ca. 5.) it was constantly called a Synod; afterwards it took up the name Convocation, from the worda cent convocari faciatis, in the Kings Writ; And (since our Scotizing) it is called an Assembly.
