This Heresie began about the year of Christ 315. in the time of Pope Silvester, and Constantine the great Emperor; and notwithstanding, Arrius and his deceived complices, were excommunicated by their own Bishop Alexander, upon the first broaching of their Tenets, and that the Heresie was condemned by the aforesaid Council of Nice; and thirdly, notwithstanding the aforesaid sudden and infamous death of the Author, the heresie died not with him, but did afterwards much spread it self (by the help of Constantine the Emperor) through all Christendom, but more in the East, then in the Western Church of God, nor is it to this day quite extinct, divers still adhering to it, especially in Transilvania and the bordering Countries.
