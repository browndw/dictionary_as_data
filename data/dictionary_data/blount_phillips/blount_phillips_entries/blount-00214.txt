Advowzen (advocatio) the reversion of a spiritual promotion, and signifies, in our Common Law, a right to present a Clergy-man to a Benefice, as much as Jus Patronatus in the Canon Law. Of this there are two sorts., Advowzen in gross, which belongs or adhears to any Manor, as parcel of the right of it; and Avowzen dependent, which depends on a Manor, as appurtenant thereunto.
