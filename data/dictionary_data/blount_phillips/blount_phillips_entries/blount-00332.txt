Allegory (allegoria) a dark speech or sentence which must be understood otherwise then the litteral interpretation shews, and is prosecuted through the whole sentence. As when St. Jo. Baptist speaking of our Saviour. Mat. 3, said, Whose fan is in his hand, and he shall make clean his floor, and gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he shall burn with unquenchable fire. The meaning is, that Christ being supreme Judge of all, shall separate the good from the evill, rewarding the one in Heaven, and punishing the other in Hell fire. Bull.
