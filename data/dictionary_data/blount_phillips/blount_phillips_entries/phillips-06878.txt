Knight, (Sax. Cnicht) hath been taken originally for a souldier or horseman in war; those that were wont to accompany and wait upon the Emperour in the wars, were called in Dutch Knechts, i. e. servitours or lusty young men. It is also taken for a client or vassal, but more especially one that holds his land by serving his Lord on horseback; it is now grown to be a Title of great Dignity and Honour. Of Knight-hoods there are many sorts, but the most usual in this Nation are these.
