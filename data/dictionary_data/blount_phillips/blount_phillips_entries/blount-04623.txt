Gradual Psalms, are fifteen Psalms so called, that is, those fifteen together from the 118. to 133. or from the 119. to 134. they are so called from a custom the Jews observed of singing them, as they ascended up those fifteen steps or stairs (in Latin gradus) which were between the womens Court and the mens of Solomons Temple, upon which steps the Levites sung those fifteen Psalms, on each step a Psalm. Rab. Da. Kim. Ps. 120.
