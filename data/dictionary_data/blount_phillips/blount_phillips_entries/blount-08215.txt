Porcellane or China Dishes, brought out of China, are made of a Chalky Earth, which (beaten and steeped in water) affords a Cream or fatness on the top, and a gross subsidence at the bottom; out of the Cream or superfluitance, the finest Dishes are made, out of the residence the courser; which being formed, they gild or paint, not after a hundred years, but presently commit to the Furnace. To which Dishes (or the finer sort of them, which they say are forbidden to be carried out of the Kingdom) Scaliger and others ascribe these properties, That they admit no poison; strike fire; will grow hot no higher then the liqour in them ariseth.
