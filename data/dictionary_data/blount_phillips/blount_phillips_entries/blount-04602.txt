Golden-Jeece, The Gold in grains, which is found in Rivers and purling Brooks, they used in some parts to gather with the help of sheep-skins, that had the wooll on them, &c. from which manner of trying or finding gold, the Fable of the Golden-fleece was invented, which Jason and his Argonautes sailed for to Pontus, and was nothing else but a robbing the Colchians of that gold which they had found out and gathered, with such Wool-skins. First part of the Treasury of Times.
