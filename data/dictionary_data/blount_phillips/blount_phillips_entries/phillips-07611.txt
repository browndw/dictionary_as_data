Marshal, (in Latin Mariscallus) was anciently no other than a Master of Horse, from the Dutch words Mar, i. a horse, and Scalc, i. a servant, but of late there are several officers of that name, as the Marshals belonging to the several Courts of Law, the Marshals of each Regiment in an Army, but the highest officers that bore this name among us, were the Lord Marshal of England, whose power consisted chiefly in matters of war and armes, and Marshals of the Kings House, whose office was to hear pleas of the Crown, and to punish faults committed within the verge.
