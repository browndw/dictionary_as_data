Gultwit, seems to be compounded of Gult, i. noxa, and wit, a termination of words in the Saxon tongue, signifying nothing in it self, but as dome or hood, Christendom, Childhood, Manhood, &c. Others say, and it is true, that wit signifies blame or reprehension. Gultwit (as Saxon in his description of England, ca. 11. interprets it) is an amends for trespass.
