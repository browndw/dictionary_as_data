Induction (inductio) a drawing, entry, or leading into; an inducement, alluring or perswasion unto; also a form of argument from particulars, proceeding to universals. We take Induction (says my Lord Bacon) to be that form of demonstration, which supports sence, presses nature, and is instanced in works, and in a sort mingled therewith.
