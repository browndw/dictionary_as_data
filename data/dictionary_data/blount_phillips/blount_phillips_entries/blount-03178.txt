Divination (divinatio) a presage or foretelling of things to come; which may be divided into three different kinds, viz. Supernatural, Natural and Superstitious. Supernatural Divination (onely revealed to man by God) is not properly called Divination but Prophecy, with which all the holy Prophets have in former times been inspired.
