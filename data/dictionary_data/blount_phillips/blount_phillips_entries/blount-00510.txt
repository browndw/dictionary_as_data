Ancil (ancile) was a short Buckler or Scutcheon which was formed without corners, being rebated on each side in the fashion of a decressant or Moon in the last quarter. This Ancile (as they say) fell from Heaven into the hands of King Numa in time of a plague at Rome, and he being advertised by Egeria, that it was for the health of the City, and ought to be kept safe, caused eleven more to be made so like, as they could not be known from the pattern, which hereby was preserved; the keeping hereof was committed to the 12. Salii. Livy & Fern.
