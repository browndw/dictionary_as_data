Gebaltark or Gebaltarec (corruptly call'd the Streights of Gibralthar) scituate in the Mediterranean Sea, on the north side whereof stood Mount Calpe, on the south mount Abila, on which Hercules, placed his so memorized Pillars, with this inscription, Nil ultra. The name comes from Gebal, which in Arabick signifies a Mountain, and Tarec the son of Abdalla, who having transported his Barbarians over the Streight, secured his Army with the natural fortifications of the place.
