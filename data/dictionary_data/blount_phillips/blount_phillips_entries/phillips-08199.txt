Newyears-gift, a gift presented to friends or great persons the first day of January, a custom derived from the ancient Romans who used to offer Presents to the Emperors in the Capitol though they were absent. In Italy it is the custom for the greatest persons to give to the meanest, whereas here the meanest give to the greatest.
