These Templars first founded and built the Temples or Templars Inne in Fleetstreet, which without controversie is the most antient of all the Inns of Court, and though they were divided into three several Houses, that is the Inner, the Middle, and the Outward Temple (which last is now converted into Essex house) yet were they at first all but one House; in which these Knights lived in great honor and opulency about one hundred years; For they had many Castles, Lordships, and Seignories belonging to them and their Order in many parts of England; and the Master of this Order was a Baron of this Nation; their Church, yet standing, was dedicated to the service of God by Heraclius, Patriarck of Jerusalem, An. Dom. 1185.
