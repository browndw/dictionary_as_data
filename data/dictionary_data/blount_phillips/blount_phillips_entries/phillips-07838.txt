Midas, a King of Phrygia, the son of Gordias a Cowheard, he having intertained Bacchus, and being bid to ask of him what ever he had a minde to, he desired that whatsoever he touchta might be turned into gold, which desire was immediately granted, and not onely every thing else he touched, but his meat also, before he could bring it to his mouth, was changed to gold, whereupon he being forced to request that he might be freed from that gift he was counselled to wash himself in Pactolus streams, which immediately became very bright with the glistering of the sands which were turned into gold, afterwards Pan having challenged Apollo to a musick duell; Tmolus being chosen Judge, Midas being the onely man that gave the victory to Pan, was adjudged for his ignorance to have Asses ears grow to his head, which disgrace neverthelesse had been concealed, had not his Barber gone into a hollow place of the earth, and cried out Midas hath Asses ears, and soon after the reeds which grew in that place became vocal, and continually uttered the same words.
