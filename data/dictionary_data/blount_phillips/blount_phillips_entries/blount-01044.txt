Augustinians (not taking name from St. Austin, the Father & Doctor of the Church, but from one Augustine a late Bohemian) are a branch of those Reformers, ordinarily called Sacramentaries, who had their origin from Andreas Carolostadius about the year of Christ, 1524. These Augustinians (besides other blasphemies) held, that Heaven gates were not yet open, but remain shut till the general Resurrection, and last Judgement. Lindanus Dialog. 2.
