Policy of Assurance or Ensurance, is a course taken by those, who adventure wares & merchandize by Sea, whereby they (unwilling to hazard their whole adventure) give to some other a certain rate or proportion, as ten in the hundred, or such like, to secure the safe arrival of the ship, and so much wares at the place agreed on; so that, if the ship and wares miscarry, the Ensurer makes good to the Venturer or Ensured, so much as he promised to secure, as 50. 100. more or less; and if the ship arrive safely he gains that clearly, which the Venturer compounds to pay him, and for the more even dealing between them in this case, there is a certain Clerk or Officer ordained, to set down in writing the sum of their agreement, that they afterwards differ not between themselves upon the bargain. This term you have An. 43. Eliz. ca 11. and in course Latin called Assecuratio.
