Io, the daughter of Inachus, King of the Argives, she being beloved of Jupiter was transformed into a Cow, that she might not be known of Juno, who neverthelesse suspecting, caused her to be watch't by Argus, who had many eyes, but Argus being slain by Mercury, Juno sent a Gadfly to sting her, which made her run up and down restlesse, till at length she arrived at Aegypt, where being restored to her former shape, she was married to Osiris, and called Isis.
