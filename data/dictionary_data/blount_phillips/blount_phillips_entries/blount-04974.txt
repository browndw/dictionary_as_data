Hugh. Aventinus derives it from the German word Houga cent n, that is, slasher or cutter. But whereas the name Hugh was first in use among the French, and Otfrid in the year 900 used Hugh for comfort, I judge this name to be borrowed thence, and so is correspondent to the Greek names Elpidius and Elpis.
