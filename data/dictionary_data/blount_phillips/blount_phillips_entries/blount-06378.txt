Masse, from the Lat. missa, but whether missa be derived from the Hebrew, or be a Latin word corrupted, is no small controversie; They that derive it from the Hebrew, conceive it comes from a in non-Latin alphabet aMissah, which signifies an Oblation or Offering; They that account it a Latin word corrupted, conceive the Fathers used it instead of missio, a sending aeway: For in antient times when the Mass or publick Service was ended, and the Communicants addressed them selves to be partakers of the holy Eucharist, it was a custom to send away the younger for, such as were not yet fully instructed and catechised; hence missa was taken for and signfied a Sacrifice, an Oblation or Offering.
