There was of old among the Israelites, a feast commanded by God, called the feast of Tabernacles, which began on the 15. day of the Seventh moneth, and continued seven days, during which time the Israelties lived abroad in Tabernacles, in remembrance a cent hat their Fathers a long time so lived, after God had delivered them out of the Land of Egypt. Now the feast of Tabernacles drew near, Lev. 23.34.
