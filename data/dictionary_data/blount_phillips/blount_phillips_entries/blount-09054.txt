Robertines, a Religious Order (if not the same, not much different from the Mathurins) which owes its original to one Robert Flower, son of Took Flower, who had been twice Mayor of York, who, forsaking the fair lands left him by his Father, betook himself to a solitary life about the Rocks in Nisdale in Yorkshire, and at Knaresborough was erected the first and last House of his Order.
