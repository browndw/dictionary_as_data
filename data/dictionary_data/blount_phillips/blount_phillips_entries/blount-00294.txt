Alchoran or Alcoran (i. Scripture) the book of the Turks Religion, first broached by Mahomet, who was an Arabian, and born in the year 572. his Father was a Pagan, and his Mother a Jew. In Arabia he was chosen Captain of a rebellious multitude, among whom he inducted a new Religion (which he pretended was revealed to him by the Angel Gabriel) consisting partly of Jewish Ceremonies, which he learned of one Abdalla, partly of Christian Precepts taught him by Sergius a Nestorian Monk, and partly of other phantastical sopperies, which his own inventions suggested to him. This Religion (if we may so call it) Osmen the fourth Caliph of the Saracens (who married Mahomets Daughter, and by that means got a sight of all his papers) reduced into four Volumes, and divided into several Chapters, the whole Body of it is but an Exposition and gloss of these eight Commandments.
