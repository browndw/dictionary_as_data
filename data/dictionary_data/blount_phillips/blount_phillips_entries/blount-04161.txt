Feud or Feid, or deadly Feud (feuda) a profession of an unquenchable hatred, till we be revenged even by the death of our enemy: and is deduced from the German word Feid, which (as Hotoman saith in verbis feudalibus) modo bellum, modo capitales inimicitias significat. This word is used 43. El. c. 13. See Feid.
