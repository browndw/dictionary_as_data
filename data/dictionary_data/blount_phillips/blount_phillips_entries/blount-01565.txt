Capitol (capitolium) an antient Pallace in Rome, so called from the head of a man found there when they digged to lay the foundation; Arnobius saith his name was Tolus, and from Caput and Tolus came Capitolium. When Brennus and his Gauls overcame the Romans near the River Allia in Italy, Rome it self was forsaken of its chief strength, only the Capitol was manned by Manlius and saved from the fury of the Gauls, by the cackling of Geese which awaked the watch, &c.
