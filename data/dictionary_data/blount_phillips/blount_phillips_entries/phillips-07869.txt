Minotaurus, the Monster which Pasiphae the wife of Minos brought forth, having had carnal copulation with a Bull, it had partly the form of a man, partly of a Bull: to this Monster the Athenians overcome by Minos, were bound by covenant to sent yearly seven of their noblest youths to be devoured; but in the third year Theseus the son of Aegeus was sent to slay the Minotaur, which having done, he escaped with the help of Ariadne out of the Labyrinth by a clew of thread.
