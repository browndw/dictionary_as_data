Oracle (oraculum) a Sentence, Council or Answer given by God; also a notable saying or judgement; a Prophesie or Prediction. Among the Gentiles these Oracles were but illusions of the Devil, who answered for the most part doubtfully in Idols, to questions made to him. As a great Prince, going to the Wars, and demanding of the Oracle what success he should have, had this ambiguous answer given him, Ibis redibis nunquam per bella peribis. Which he thus commaing, Ibis, redibis, nunquam per &c. ventured on the War, and was slain.
