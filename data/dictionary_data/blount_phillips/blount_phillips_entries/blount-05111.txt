Iehovah (Hebr.) is Gods proper name of his own imposition, and incommunicable to any creature, of what rank or quality soever; a name of such immoderate reverence among the eldest Jews, that it was forbidden to be written right, or pronounced at all in this world, but by the High-Priest, and but in one place, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and but at one time of the year, in the day of expiation. Gregory, p. 5.
