Downes, With us hath two significations; the one, certain hilly Plains in the West Country, so called; and this Down comes from the old Saxon Dune, i. a hill, commonly that stretcheth it self out in length: The other a certain part of the Sea lying near the Sands upon the coast of Kent, where commonly our English Navy rides; and this we borrow from the Hollanders, who call the Sandbanks, which lye on the Sea-side, the Dunes; And the Town of Dunkirk, rightly in English, Dun-Church, took denomination from its being scituate in the Dunes or Sandbanks of the Sea.
