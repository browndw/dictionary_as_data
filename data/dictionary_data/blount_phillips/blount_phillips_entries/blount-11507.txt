Wreck (From the Fr. Varech) is where a ship perishes at Sea, and no person escapes alive out of it; the Civilians call it Naufragium. This Wreck being made, the goods that were in any part of the Ship (being brought to Land by the waves) belong to the King by his Prerogative, or to him to whom he has granted this priviledge. An. 17 Edw. 2. cap. 11. But if any person in the Ship come to land, it is on Wreck, or if either Dog or Cat escape alive, the goods are the owners still, so he comes within a year and a day to claim them. And for this the Statute is plain. VVestm. 1. cap. 4. An. 3 Ed. 1. The Emperors of Rome made no advantage of this sad event, as appears Titulo de Naufragiis, 11. Cod. And Richard the first had some remorse of poor Seamens miseries in this case; for he quietum clamavit VVreck suis subditis. Hoved. Part. post. Annal. f. 386.
