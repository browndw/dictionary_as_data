Sardonian Laughter (risus Sardonius) a long and causeless laughter, whereof the end is sorrowful; so used from the Hearb Sardoa, which being of a poisonous nature, causes men to dye with such a convulsion or contraction of their sinews, that they seem to grin or laugh. This Herb is like Smalage, and is found in Sardinia.
