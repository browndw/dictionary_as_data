            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had bestowed the waste hours of some years in reading our best Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Histories and Authors; I found, though I had gained a reasonable knowledge in the Latin and French Tongues, as I thought, and had a smattering both of Greek and other Languages, yet I was often gravell'd in English Books; that is, I encountred such words, as I either not at all, or not throughly understood, more then what the preceding sence did insinuate: For Example:</p>
                  <p>In the Turkish History I met with <hi>Ianizaries, Mufties, Timariots, Basha's, Seraglio's, Shashes, Turbants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the French History, the <hi>Salique Law, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennages, Vidams, Daulphin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Spanish, the <hi>Escurial, Infanta, Sanbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Roman Histories I often found mention of <hi>Consuls, Tribunes, Dictators, Pretors, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, Legions, Theaters, Obelisks;</hi> The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol, Vatican, Pasquin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in many other Books, mention of several <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb facs="tcp:42316:3"/>
Orders;</hi> as <hi>Carmelites, Carthusians, Cistersians, Theatins, Bonhomes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise both of antient and modern <hi>Sects;</hi> as <hi>Arrians, Eutychians, Iacobites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Anabaptists, Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Erastians, Thraskites, Socinians, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Books of Divinity, I found <hi>Sanhedrim, V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim, Shibboleth; Hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Circuminsession, Introversion, Extrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In every <hi>Mercurius, Coranto, Gazet,</hi> or <hi>Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> I met with <hi>Camizado's, Pallizado's, Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spezado's, Brigades, Squadrons, Curasiers, Bonmine, Halts, Iuncta's, Paroles <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mouths of common people, I heard of <hi>Piaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, Balcone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>By this new world of Words, I found we were slipt into that condition which <hi>Seneca</hi> complains of in his time; <hi>When mens minds once begin to enure themselves to dislike, whatever is usual is disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: They affect novelty in speech, they recal ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worn and uncouth words, they forge new phrases, and that which is newest is best liked; there is presumptuous, and far fetching of words: And some there are that think it a grace, if their speech hover, and thereby hold the hearer in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I believ'd my self not singular in this ignorance; and that few, without the help of a <hi>Dictionary,</hi> would be able to understand our ordinary English Books. I found nothing considerable in this kinde extant, though now many make it their study to be learned in our own Language; and I remember <hi>Aristotles, Verba valent in usu sicut &amp; nummi.</hi> For these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and to indulge my own fancy, I began to compile this Work; which has taken me up the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of above Twenty years.</p>
                  <p>Besides the <hi>Words</hi> of the nature before specified, you have here such and so many of the most useful <hi>Law Terms</hi> as I thought necessary for every Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:42316:4"/>
of Estate to understand, not intending any thing elaborate for the studied Professors of that noble <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> there being some excellent Pieces of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture already extant; yet I have glean'd divers Law-terms which escaped both <hi>Cowel</hi> and the <hi>Terms of Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The several parts of mans body, as the <hi>Pia</hi> and <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> the <hi>Messentery, Muscles,</hi> several sorts of <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi> with their proper Appellations; As also the names and qualities of at least ordinary Diseases, I thought fit for the knowledg of many, who neither profess the study of <hi>Physick, Anatomy,</hi> nor <hi>Chyrurgery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I held it no less necessary for every Gentleman to be so far seen in Heraldry, as to know (at least) the most usual Terms; as when a Lyon or other Beast is said to be <hi>Dormant, Passant, Couchant, Saliant, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant, Seisant, Regardant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi> and what is meant by a <hi>Fesse, Canton, Bend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi> that he may by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence be able to blazon his own Coat.</p>
                  <p>Here are likewise explicated all Latin words, that are used without alteration in English, as <hi>Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Peccavi, Verbatim, Verago, Bona side, De bene esse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi> And, with these, the terms of many <hi>Sciences</hi> unfolded; as, of <hi>Logick, Astrology, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, Musick, Architecture, Navigation,</hi> &amp;c. with those of our most ingenious <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Exercises,</hi> as <hi>Printing, Painting, Jewelling; Riding, Hunting, Hawking,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Yet I will not say I have met with all that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire explication, for that were an imployment for <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymedes,
<pb facs="tcp:42316:4"/>
Pulveris Erythraei subducere numerum:</hi> But I have inserted such as are of most use, and best worth knowledge; that is, <hi>Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula.</hi> To some words I have added <hi>Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> to others, <hi>Historical Observations,</hi> as they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, and this but <hi>ex obliquo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have avoided <hi>Poetical Stories,</hi> as much as I could, since they are not necessary to be understood by the generality; and as for Schollars and Poets, there is a copious Latin Dictionary of them, and somewhat of late done in English by Mr. <hi>Ross;</hi> Yet sometimes I am forced to touch a little upon that string; as to tell the story of <hi>Pandora,</hi> to make her <hi>Boc</hi> understood, and that of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> to render the word <hi>Tantalize</hi> intelligible.</p>
                  <p>I have likewise in a great measure, shun'd the old <hi>Saxon Words;</hi> as finding them growing every day more obsolete then other. Besides there is an excellent <hi>Dictionary</hi> thereof shortly expected from the learned Mr. <hi>Sumner.</hi> Yet even such of those, as I found still in use, are not here omitted.</p>
                  <p>In this Design, I met with two <hi>Objections;</hi> The First, that my labor would finde no end; since our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Tongue daily changes habit, every fantastical <hi>Traveller,</hi> and home-bred <hi>Sciolist</hi> being at liberty, as, to antiquate and decry the old, so to coyn and innovate new Words: Which <hi>Horace</hi> thus observed,

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:42316:5"/>Signifying hereby that words in Common Tongues, like leaves, must of necessity have their buddings, their blossomings, their ripenings and their fallings: Which old <hi>Chaucer</hi> also thus remarks.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>I know that in form of speech is change</l>
                     <l>VVithin a hundred years and words tho</l>
                     <l>That hidden price, now wonder nice and strange</l>
                     <l>Think we them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet they speak them so,</l>
                     <l>And sped as well in love, as men now do.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This we grant, and confess it impossible to keep Words of unlearned Tongues from falling and change in tract of time; which has even happened among the Latin Writers themselves, when theirs was a spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Tongue as ours now is; who though they first made their own words, and gave them their allowance, yet divers of <hi>Cecilius, Statius, Ennius,</hi> and <hi>Plautus</hi> were by posterior Latinists rejected; and now again many of them, by the last Writers of all (though before, as it were, by Proclamation put down for baseness) are, upon a new Touch, warranted for good, and pass abroad as Sterling; thus we see our <hi>Latin Dictionaries</hi> sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never Reprinted, without some Additions, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, or Denotations of obsolete Words: So when any considerable Supplement of new <hi>English Words</hi> have legally passed the Mint and Test of our <hi>Vertuos,</hi> the same liberty may be allowed this Work; not deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating at all from the use of it in the <hi>interim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second Objection was, That the use of such words was not commendable, according to that of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar, Tanquam scopulum vitari debes verbum infre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens;</hi> and he that should use them would be subject

Nor is it my purpose to become an Advocate for the use of such Words; let every ones <hi>Genius</hi> and the quality of the Subject they treat of be their own <hi>Dictator;</hi> but certainly, at least to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them can be no unnecessary burden to the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; since Knowledge is <hi>Animi pabulum.</hi> And 'tis <hi>Galens</hi> Axiom, <hi>Whoever is ignorant of words, shal never judge well of things.</hi> Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Method. c. <hi>5.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:42316:6"/>
more significant, compendious, and effectual to declare the true sence of the matter, then if they were expressed in pure Latin.</hi>

                  <p>And Mr. <hi>Denham,</hi> in his quaint <hi>Preface</hi> to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Troy; As Speech is the Apparel of our Thoughts, so are there certain Garbes and Modes of speaking, which vary with the times; the fashion of our Clothes not being more subject to alteration, then that of our Speech: And this I think</hi> Tacitus <hi>means, by that which he calls</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monem temporis istius auribus accommodatum; <hi>The delight of change being as due to the curiosity of the Ear, as of the Eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus solved these two main <hi>Objections,</hi> I may, with an humble confidence, hope this Book will prove as useful to our Nation, as that Congenerous <hi>Essay, Des Merveilles de Nature,</hi> done by <hi>René,</hi> is to the French; which has been Printed almost twenty several times within little more then so many years.</p>
                  <p>To compile and compleat a Work of this nature and importance, would necessarily require an <hi>Encyclope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> of knowledge, and the concurrence of many learned Heads; yet that I may a little secure the Reader from a just apprehension of my disability for so great an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, I profess to have done little with my own Pencil; but have extracted the quintessence of <hi>Scapula, Minsheu, Cotgrave, Spelmans Glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarium, Florio, Thomasius, Dasipodius, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Hexams Dutch,</hi> and Dr <hi>Davies</hi> Welsh Dictionaries, <hi>Cowels</hi> Interpreter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other able Authors, for so much as tended to my purpose; and
<pb facs="tcp:42316:6"/>
hope I have taken nothing upon trust, which is not authentick; yet should not I thus adventure to make it publick, but that it also had the perusal and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some very Learned, and my Noble Friends.</p>
                  <p>It is chiefly intended for the more-knowing Women, and less-learned Men; or indeed for all such of the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate, who can but finde, in an Alphabet, the word they understand not; yet I think I may modestly say, the best of Schollars may in some part or other be obliged by it. For he that is a good <hi>Hebrician, Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Latinist,</hi> perhaps may be to seek in the <hi>Italian, French</hi> or <hi>Spanish;</hi> or if he be skil'd in all those, he may here find some <hi>Words, Terms of Art,</hi> or <hi>Notions,</hi> that have no dependence upon any of those Languages.</p>
                  <p>Such as neither understand <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Latin,</hi> may, with a little pains, and the help of this Book, know the meaning of the greatest part of such words as we now use in English, and are derived from either of those Languages, which are many, and to facilitate this, they may do well to learn the numbers in those Languages, as <hi>En, dyo, treis, &amp;c. unus, duo, tres, &amp;c.</hi> and such words and particles as are most used in Composition; as <hi>Monos, Hemi, Pseudos, Tetra, &amp;c. Circum, Subter, Praeter, Ultra, &amp;c.</hi> and then in sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple words to understand but the nature and difference between a <hi>Verb, Verbal, Noun, Participle, &amp;c.</hi> that when they know one of them, they may also compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all the Derivatives from the same Fountain; as to <hi>illaqueate, illaqueator, illaqueation, illaquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted-illaqueable, &amp;c.</hi> And by once throughly learning these, all other words of this nature, which are not a few, would seem easie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:42316:7"/>So likewise for compound Words, knowing <hi>Pseudos</hi> to signifie false, they would understand <hi>Pseudo Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> to be a <hi>False Prophet; circum,</hi> about, or round about; <hi>circumstation,</hi> a standing round about, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the like. And this easiness of understanding all the words that come from one root, when one of them is known, made me forbear to insert the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of such words; presuming if the Reader know one or two of them, he will not be ignorant of the rest; and I have selected the most difficult.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the same word is used both <hi>Substantive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Adjectively;</hi> as, <hi>Datary, Expedient, Laudative, Missive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi> And sometime both <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantively</hi> and <hi>Verbally;</hi> as <hi>Attique, Reprive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </hi> which being unrestrained in the use, were almost impossible to observe in all Words: besides, if it be interpreted in the one acception, it will easily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in the other.</p>
                  <p>So likewise there is a liberty in most Adjectives, whether you will say <hi>Optique</hi> (after the <hi>French</hi>) <hi>Optick, Opticous,</hi> or <hi>Optical;</hi> which I thought unnecessary always to remark.</p>
                  <p>If I say a word is <hi>Greek, French, Italian,</hi> &amp;c. I speak not always in rigor; for, commonly the words we borrow from other Languages, are a little altered from their Originals to make them speak English.</p>
                  <p>Something might also be said of the choice of Words in our refined English Tongue; which are to be liked and approved according to their tone, and the sweetness of their cadence, that is, as they run musically in the Ear. <hi>Latin</hi> Verbs of the first Conjugation are more
<pb facs="tcp:42316:7"/>
usually converted into English; as <hi>contamino, as,</hi> to contaminate; <hi>recalcitro, as,</hi> to recalcitrate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then those of the second, third or fourth Conjugations.</p>
                  <p>I have madcause of several Authors of different perswasions in Controversial points both of Religion and other Literature, which possibly will not please all Readers; and therefore must crave pardon, in this particular, if some Citations pass under a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquent,</hi> since the nature of the Words inforced me to have recourse thereto.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, though I may truly say, I have taken much pains in this investigation of Words, yet it is but too probable, that <hi>in multiloquio non deerit pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum;</hi> that in so great a Circumference, some Lines may not be truly drawn from the Centre; which yet I hope will not draw an oblique censure from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but his pardon rather, and animadversion; that I may, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> advises, <hi>Et scribendo profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere &amp; proficiendo scribere, &amp; quae nescio di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scere.</hi> De Trin, lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>

The second dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, that for the recovery of an Annuity, no Action lies, but onely the Writ of Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against the Granter, his heirs or successors: but of a Rent the same Actions lie, as do of Land, as the case re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.

The Inhabitants of these <hi>Cinque Ports</hi> and of their members, enjoy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers priviledges above the rest of the Commons of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They pay no Subsidies; Suits at Law are commenced and answered within their own Liberties; their Majors have the credit of carrying the Canopy over the King or Queen at their Coronation. And for their greater dignity, they are placed then at a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the right hand of the King. <hi>Min.</hi> See the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of these Cinque Ports, and of the Lord Warden, in <hi>Camdens Brit. fol.</hi> 230.</p>

                  </hi> a figure or number, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, are the figures, and (0) a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher in Arithmetick, Which (0) of it self is of no value, but encreaseth the value of other figures, to which it is joyned. Hence 'tis we use to say that person stands for a cipher, who being in company of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, neither speaks nor acts as they do.</p>
               <p>There is also a kind of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which we call by Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers or Characters, whereof every exercised Statesman hath peculiar to himself, and which was invented by <hi>J. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> when he first began to think of the Roman Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and was by him in his Letters to his more private and retired friends, used, that if by misfortune they should be intercepted, the contents of them should not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; <hi>ne obvia literarum le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio cuivis esset.

               <p>Of these there are many kindes, as Ciphers simple; cyphers intermixt with Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes or non-significant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; cyphers of double letters under one character; wheel-cyphers, kay-cyphers; cyphers of words, cyphers of actions and others, <hi>Bac.

This revolution is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Sun, taking name from <hi>Sunday,</hi> the letter whereof (called therefore <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minical</hi>) it appoints for every year.

               <p>The <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Moon is the revolution of 19 years, in which space (though not precisely) the Lunations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur. For, because of the Sun and Moons unequal motions, the changes falli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Cycle is therefore called <hi>Cyclus decennovennalis,</hi> and from the Author <hi>Annus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicus</hi>; from whose Atheni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans the Egyptians may seem to have received it, as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans from them, in Letters of gold; from whence (if not from the more precious use of it) it obtained to be called, as it still is, the <hi>numerus aureus,</hi> or <hi>Golden number.</hi> It was made Christian by the Fathers of the <hi>Nicene-Council,</hi> as being altogether necessary to the finding out the <hi>Neomenia Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalis,</hi> upon which the Feast of Easter, and all the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rest depended. It self is found by adding an unite to the year of our Lord, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the whole by 19. the remainder shall be the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Moon; or if nothing remain, the <hi>Cycle</hi> is out, that is nineteen.

Then kneeling down the Bishops Deputy first takes from him all these things, commanding him to say no more Masses. Secondly, scraping his fingers end with a piece of glass, he enjoyns him never to hallow any thing. And thirdly, stripping him of his Priestly Vestments, he is clothed in a Lay habit, and so delivered into the power of the Secular Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, if his offence so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>

                  <hi>Degree,</hi> A term often used in Astronomy and Physick. In Astronomy it signifies the thirtieth part of a Sign <hi>(viz.)</hi> of <hi>Aries, Taurus, Gemini,</hi> &amp;c. for into so many parts or degrees are all these Signs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. In Physick it signifies a proportion of heat, or cold, moysture or driness in the nature of Simples; and there are four such proportions or <hi>Degrees.</hi> The first Degree is so small, that it can scarce be perceived. The second, that which manifestly may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without hurting the sence. The third, that which somewhat offends the sense. The fourth, which so much offends, that it may destroy the body. For example, <hi>sweet Almonds, Rice, Bugloss, ripe Grapes,</hi> are hot in the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: <hi>Parsley, Saffron, Honey,</hi> in the second degree: <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, Galingal, Pepper,</hi> in the third degree: And <hi>Garlick, Spourge, Euphorbium</hi> in the fourth degree. So <hi>Barley</hi> is cold in the first degree, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers</hi> in the second, <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green</hi> in the third, and <hi>Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> in the fourth degree.

For example, If a horse should strike his keeper, and so kill him: If a man in driving a Cart, and seeking to redress any thing about it, should so fall, as the Cart-wheel run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over him, should press him to death: If one should be felling of a tree, and giving warning to company by, when the tree were near fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to look to themselves, and any of them should be slain nevertheless by the fall of the tree. In the first of these cases, the Horse; In the second, the Cart-wheel, Cart and Horses; and in the third, the Tree is to be given to God, that is to be sold and distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the poor for an expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this dreadful event, though effected by unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures. <hi>Stawnf. pl.

                  </hi> a presage or foretelling of things to come; which may be divided into three different kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Supernatural, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Superstitious. <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Divination</hi> (onely revealed to man by God) is not properly called Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but Prophecy, with which all the holy Prophets have in former times been inspired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Natural Divination,</hi> may be divided into two branches, whereof the first is that which hath in former times been practised by wicked spirits in Oracles and Answers given by them in Idols, and is at this day sometimes seen in possessed persons, who by sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of the Devil may fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel things to come, and this is but a <hi>Natural Divination</hi>: For though to us it seem mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, because of our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in the causes and courses of things, yet in those spirits it is but natural, who by their long experience and great observation, besides the knowledge of secrets in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and their quick intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from all places, are able to fore-see much more, then we by nature can.</p>
               <p>The second Branch of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Divination</hi> is that, which a wise man may foretell by probable conjecture, being no way offensive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so long as it is onely guided by reason, and over-ruled by submitting it self to the Almighty power of God. And to this second kind of Divination, Astrology may also be referred which (by the motion and influence of Stars and Planets) promises to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel many things, so long as it keeps it self in due limits and arrogates not too much to the certainty thereof; into which excess of vanity, if it once break forth, it is then no longer called Natural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination, but Superstitious and wicked; For the Stars may incline, but not impose a necessity on particular things.</p>
               <p>The third and last manner of <hi>Divination</hi> is that which we call <hi>Superstitious</hi>; whereof there has been among the Gentiles divers different kinds. As namely, <hi>Augury,</hi> by the flying, feeding, and chirp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Birds. <hi>Alphitomancy,</hi> by Barley meal. <hi>Auruspicy,</hi> by
<pb facs="tcp:42316:108"/>
opening and viewing the bowels of Beasts. <hi>Necromancy,</hi> by calling up Devils or dead mens Ghosts. <hi>Geomancy,</hi> by making certain circles and lines in the earth. <hi>Hydroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> by some apparition in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Pyromancy,</hi> by the fire, or by spirits appearing in the fire. <hi>Palmistry,</hi> or <hi>Chiromancy,</hi> by looking on the lines of the fingers and hands. <hi>Coscino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy,</hi> by a Sieve. <hi>Aeromancy,</hi> by the Air. <hi>Capnomancy,</hi> by the flying of smoak. <hi>Catoptro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy,</hi> by visions in a glass. <hi>Sorcery,</hi> or <hi>Cleromancy,</hi> by lots. <hi>Armomancy,</hi> by the shoulders of beasts. <hi>Axiomancy,</hi> by Hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. <hi>Daphnomancy,</hi> by a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel or Bay-tree. <hi>Alectryoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> by a Cock. <hi>Alebromancy,</hi> by Barly meal mixed with Wheat. <hi>Botanomancy,</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of herbs. <hi>Cephaleonomancy</hi> by an Asses head broiled on coals. <hi>Ceromancy,</hi> by wax put into water. <hi>Lithomancy,</hi> by a stone. <hi>Belomancy,</hi> by Arrows. <hi>Libanomancy,</hi> by Incense or Frankincense. <hi>Metopomancy,</hi> by the face. <hi>Necyomancy</hi> by conference with dead bodies raised, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

meet to consult of, and determine matters; also the Assembly it self; But, by an appropriation of the word, it is commonly taken for the highest Court of Judicature, or supreme Council of the Jews, which consisted of the High Priest, and seventy Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors or Elders; from which number it was called by them in Hebrew words, signifying, <hi>Domus judicii septuaginta uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, i.</hi> a Court of seventy and one Judges; and it was (as it were) their Parliament, to consult about, to judge and decide the greatest matters that could arise in their Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical or Civil Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; as, to determine the Controversies that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen concerning their High Priest, true and false Prophets, differences betwixt Nation and Nation, Tribe and Tribe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This High Court was first (by the commandment of God) instituted in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness by <hi>Moses,</hi> whilst un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his conduct, the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were on their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> towards the Land of Promise; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it continued still in vigor till our Saviors Passion.</p>
               <p>Besides this great <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> called, <hi>Sanhedrim Gedola,</hi> the Jews had two lesser or inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to it; the one consisting of three Judges; to the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Decision of which Court, the most petty actions were subject; As private Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, Thefts and the like; this they called by words of their Language, signifying, <hi>Domus judicii trium virum,</hi> The Court of three Judges. The other consisted of twenty and three, and so was termed, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus judicii viginti trium,</hi> to whose Court belonged the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of weightier Sutes and capital Causes.</p>
               <p>These Courts were erected in several places, according to the exigence and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of their Country, whereas their other supreme Court, after their possession of the Land of Promise, and the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, was only held in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>; Jews might appeal from those inferior Courts, to this; but from this there lay no appeal. Four kinds of death were in their power, Stoning, Burning, Sword, Strangling; and they fasted all that day when they condemned any to death. See <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, p.</hi> 189.</p>

                  <hi>Sewer</hi> or <hi>Sewar,</hi> has two significations, one applied to him that ushers or comes in before the meat of the King or other great Personage, and placeth it on the Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The other, to such passages or gutters, as carry water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea or River, in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers Latin called <hi>Sewera, A.</hi> 6. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 5.
